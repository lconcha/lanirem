abstract: Ageing displays a low-grade pro-inflammatory profile in blood and the brain.
  Accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglia activation and volumetric
  changes in the brain correlate with cognitive decline in ageing models. However,
  the interplay between them is not totally understood. Here, we aimed to globally
  identify an age-dependent pro-inflammatory profile and microglia morphological plasticity
  that favors major volume changes in the brain associated with cognitive decline.
  Cluster analysis of behavioral data obtained from 2-,12- and 20-month-old male C57BL/6
  mice revealed age-dependent cognitive decline after the Y-maze, Barnes maze, object
  recognition (NORT) and object location tests (OLT). Global magnetic resonance imageing
  (MRI) analysis by deformation-based morphometry (DBM) in the brain identified a
  volume increase in the fornix and a decrease in the left medial entorhinal cortex
  (MEntC) during ageing. Notably, the fornix shows an increase in the accumulation
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas the left MEntC displays a decrease. Morphological
  assessment of microglia also confirms an active and dystrophic phenotype in the
  fornix and a surveillance phenotype in the left MEntC. Finally, biological modeling
  revealed that age-related volume increase in the fornix was associated with dystrophic
  microglia and cognitive impairment, as evidenced by failure on tasks examining memory
  of object location and novelty. Our results propose that the morphological plasticity
  of microglia might contribute to volumetric changes in brain regions associated
  with cognitive decline during physiological ageing.
