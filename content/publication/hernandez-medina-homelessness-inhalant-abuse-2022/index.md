abstract: This work presents an interdisciplinary case study of a man who has used
  inhalants for 15 years and has been homeless since childhood. He exhibited a reduction
  in brain white matter and mild deterioration in memory and attention. However, other
  cognitive and construct abilities were intact and functionally observed in activities
  related to work, play, and survival during his life on the streets. Impairments
  in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices may be implicated in the participant's
  inhalant abuse, while decreased functional connectivity involving the language network
  may explain the participant's difficulty to verbally express his feelings and life
  story. Inhalants impair brain white matter, resulting in cognitive, affective, and
  social insufficiencies. However, the participant does not use other substances and
  expressed healthy habits and empathic concern towards others. In addition, life
  on the street creates community bonds and challenges people with stimulation which
  could lessen the effects of inhalants.
