abstract: 'Objective Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common pharmacoresistant
  epilepsy in adults. Here we profiled local neural function in TLE in vivo, building
  on prior evidence that has identified widespread structural alterations. Using resting-state
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), we mapped the whole-brain intrinsic
  neural timescales (INT), which reflect temporal hierarchies of neural processing.
  Parallel analysis of structural and diffusion MRI data examined associations with
  TLE-related structural compromise. Finally, we evaluated the clinical utility of
  INT. Methods We studied 46 patients with TLE and 44 healthy controls from two independent
  sites, and mapped INT changes in patients relative to controls across hippocampal,
  subcortical, and neocortical regions. We examined region-specific associations to
  structural alterations and explored the effects of age and epilepsy duration. Supervised
  machine learning assessed the utility of INT for identifying patients with TLE vs
  controls and left- vs right-sided seizure onset. Results Relative to controls, TLE
  showed marked INT reductions across multiple regions bilaterally, indexing faster
  changing resting activity, with strongest effects in the ipsilateral medial and
  lateral temporal regions, and bilateral sensorimotor cortices as well as thalamus
  and hippocampus. Findings were similar, albeit with reduced effect sizes, when correcting
  for structural alterations. INT reductions in TLE increased with advancing disease
  duration, yet findings differed from the aging effects seen in controls. INT-derived
  classifiers discriminated patients vs controls (balanced accuracy, 5-fold: 76% $±$
  2.65%; cross-site, 72%–83%) and lateralized the focus in TLE (balanced accuracy,
  5-fold: 96% $±$ 2.10%; cross-site, 95%–97%), with high accuracy and cross-site generalizability.
  Findings were consistent across both acquisition sites and robust when controlling
  for motion and several methodological confounds. Significance Our findings demonstrate
  atypical macroscale function in TLE in a topography that extends beyond mesiotemporal
  epicenters. INT measurements can assist in TLE diagnosis, seizure focus lateralization,
  and monitoring of disease progression, which emphasizes promising clinical utility.'
