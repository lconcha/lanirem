 abstractnote = {Dopamine, and specifically the D2 system, has been implicated in timing tasks where the absolute duration of individual time intervals is encoded discretely, yet the role of D2 during beat perception and entrainment remains largely unknown. In this type of timing, a beat is perceived as the pulse that marks equally spaced points in time and, once extracted, produces the tendency in humans to entrain or synchronize their movements to it. Hence, beat-based timing is crucial for musical execution. In this study we investigated the effects of systemic injections of quinpirole (0.005–0.05 mg/kg), a D2-like agonist, on the isochronous rhythmic tapping of rhesus monkeys, a classical task for the study of beat entrainment. We compared the rhythmic timing accuracy, precision, and the asynchronies of the monkeys with or without the effects of quinpirole, as well as their reaction times in a control serial reaction time task (SRTT). The results showed a dose-dependent disruption in the scalar property of rhythmic timing due to quinpirole administration. Specifically, we found similar temporal variabilities as a function of the metronome tempo at the largest dose, instead of the increase in variability across durations that is characteristic of the timing Weber law. Notably, these effects were not due to alterations in the basic sensorimotor mechanism for tapping to a sequence of flashing stimuli, because quinpirole did not change the reaction time of the monkeys during SRTT. These findings support the notion of a key role of the D2 system in the rhythmic timing mechanism, especially in the control of temporal precision.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Perceiving and moving to the beat of music is a fundamental trait of musical cognition. We measured the effect of quinpirole, a D2-like agonist, on the precision and accuracy of rhythmic tapping to a metronome in two rhesus monkeys. Quinpirole produced a flattening of the temporal variability as a function of tempo duration, instead of the increase in variability across durations that is characteristic of the scalar property, a hallmark property of timing.},
