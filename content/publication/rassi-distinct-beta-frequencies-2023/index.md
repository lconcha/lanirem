abstract: Based on prior findings of content-specific beta synchronization in working
  memory and decision making, we hypothesized that beta oscillations support the (re-)activation
  of cortical representations by mediating neural ensemble formation. We found that
  beta activity in monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and pre-supplementary
  motor area (preSMA) reflects the content of a stimulus in relation to the task context,
  regardless of its objective properties. In duration- and distance-categorization
  tasks, we changed the boundary between categories from one block of trials to the
  next. We found that two distinct beta-band frequencies were consistently associated
  with the two relative categories, with activity in these bands predicting the animals'
  responses. We characterized beta at these frequencies as transient bursts, and showed
  that dlPFC and preSMA are connected via these distinct frequency channels. These
  results support the role of beta in forming neural ensembles, and further show that
  such ensembles synchronize at different beta frequencies., How the brain achieves
  context-dependent, flexible categorization remains poorly understood. By looking
  at neural ensemble formation, this study finds that distinct beta rhythms signal
  categorical decisions, and category-selective neurons synchronize at those frequencies.
