abstract: 'Background: Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is endemic in non-developed regions
  of the world. Two forms of NCC have been described, for which neurological morbidity
  depends on the location of the lesion, which can be either within the cerebral parenchyma
  or in extraparenchymal spaces. The extraparenchymal form (EXP-NCC) is considered
  the most severe form of NCC. EXP-NCC often requires several cycles of cysticidal
  treatment and the concomitant use of glucocorticoids to prevent increased inflammation,
  which could lead to intracranial hypertension and, in rare cases, to death. Thus,
  the improvement of EXP-NCC treatment is greatly needed. Methods: An experimental
  murine model of EXP-NCC, as an adequate model to evaluate new therapeutic approaches,
  and the parameters that support it are described. EXP-NCC was established by injecting
  30 Taenia crassiceps cysticerci, which are less than 0.5 mm in diameter, into the
  cisterna magna of male and female Wistar rats. Results: Cyst implantation and infection
  progression were monitored by detecting the HP10 antigen and anti-cysticercal antibodies
  in the serum and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of infected rats and by magnetic resonance
  imaging. Higher HP10 levels were observed in CSF than in the sera, as in the case
  of human EXP-NCC. Low cell recruitment levels were observed surrounding established
  cysticerci in histological analysis, with a modest increase in GFAP and Iba1 expression
  in the parenchyma of female animals. Low cellularity in CSF and low levels of C-reactive
  protein are consistent with a weak inflammatory response to this infection. After
  150 days of infection, EXP-NCC is accompanied by reduced levels of mononuclear cell
  proliferation, resembling the human disease. EXP-NCC does not affect the behavior
  or general status of the rats. Conclusions: This model will allow the evaluation
  of new approaches to control neuroinflammation and immunomodulatory treatments to
  restore and improve the specific anti-cysticercal immunity in EXP-NCC.'
