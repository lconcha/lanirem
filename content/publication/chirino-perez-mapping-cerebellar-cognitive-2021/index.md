abstract: The cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) has been consistently
  described in patients with acute/subacute cerebellar injuries. However, studies
  with chronic patients have had controversial findings that have not been explored
  with new cerebellar-target tests, such as the CCAS scale (CCAS-S). The objective
  of this research is to prove and contrast the usefulness of the CCAS-S and the Montreal
  Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test to evaluate cognitive/affective impairments in
  patients with chronic acquired cerebellar lesions, and to map the cerebellar areas
  whose lesions correlated with dysfunctions in these tests. CCAS-S and MoCA were
  administrated to 22 patients with isolated chronic cerebellar strokes and a matched
  comparison group. The neural bases underpinning both tests were explored with multivariate
  lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) methods. MoCA and CCAS-S had an adequate test performance
  with efficient discrimination between patients and healthy volunteers. However,
  only impairments determined by the CCAS-S resulted in significant regional localization
  within the cerebellum. Specifically, patients with chronic cerebellar lesions in
  right-lateralized posterolateral regions manifested cognitive impairments inherent
  to CCAS. These findings concurred with the anterior-sensorimotor/posterior-cognitive
  dichotomy in the human cerebellum and revealed clinically intra- and cross-lobular
  significant regions (portions of right lobule VI, VII, Crus I-II) for verbal tasks
  that overlap with the \"language\" functional boundaries in the cerebellum. Our
  findings prove the usefulness of MoCA and CCAS-S to reveal cognitive impairments
  in patients with chronic acquired cerebellar lesions. This study extends the understanding
  of long-term CCAS and introduces multivariate LSM methods to identify clinically
  intra- and cross-lobular significant regions underpinning chronic CCAS.
