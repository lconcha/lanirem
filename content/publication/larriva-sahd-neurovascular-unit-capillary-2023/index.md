abstract: We describe a pericapillary organ in the rat forebrain and cerebellar cortex.
  It consists of a series of tripartite synapses with synaptic extensions enveloped
  by astrocytic endfeet that are linked to the capillary wall by synaptic extensions.
  Reciprocal specializations of the pericyte-capillary blood vessel (CBV) with such
  specialized synapses suggest a mechanoreceptor role. In Golgi-impregnated and 3D
  reconstructions of the cerebral cortex and thalamus, a series of TSs appear to be
  sequentially ordered in a common dendrite, paralleled by synaptic outgrowths termed
  golf club synaptic extensions (GCE) opposed to a longitudinal crest (LC) from the
  capillary basal lamina (BL). Our results show that, in the cerebellar cortex, afferent
  fibers and interneurons display microanatomical structures that strongly suggest
  an interaction with the capillary wall. Afferent mossy fiber (MF) rosettes and ascending
  granule cell axons and their dendrites define the pericapillary passage interactions
  that are entangled by endfeet. The presence of mRNA of the mechanosensitive channel
  Piezo1 in the MF rosettes, together with the surrounding end-feet and the capillary
  wall form mechanosensory units. The ubiquity of such units to modulate synaptic
  transmission is also supported by Piezo1 mRNA expressing pyramidal isocortical and
  thalamic neurons. This scenario suggests that ascending impulses to the cerebellar
  and cortical targets are presynaptically modulated by the reciprocal interaction
  with the mechanosensory pericapillary organ that ultimately modulates the vasomotor
  response.
