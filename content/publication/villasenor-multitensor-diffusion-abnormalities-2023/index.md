abstract: Focal cortical dysplasias are a type of malformations of cortical development
  that are a common cause of drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Surgical treatment is
  a viable option for some of these patients, with their outcome being highly related
  to complete surgical resection of lesions visible in magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI). However, subtle lesions often go undetected on conventional imaging. Several
  methods to analyze MRI have been proposed, with the common goal of rendering subtle
  cortical lesions visible. However, most image-processing methods are targeted to
  detect the macroscopic characteristics of cortical dysplasias, which do not always
  correspond to the microstructural disarrangement of these cortical malformations.
  Quantitative analysis of diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) enables the inference of
  tissue characteristics, and novel methods provide valuable microstructural features
  of complex tissue, including gray matter. We investigated the ability of advanced
  dMRI descriptors to detect diffusion abnormalities in an animal model of cortical
  dysplasia. For this purpose, we induced cortical dysplasia in 18 animals that were
  scanned at 30 postnatal days (along with 19 control animals). We obtained multi-shell
  dMRI, to which we fitted single and multi-tensor representations. Quantitative dMRI
  parameters derived from these methods were queried using a curvilinear coordinate
  system to sample the cortical mantle, providing inter-subject anatomical correspondence.
  We found region- and layer-specific diffusion abnormalities in experimental animals.
  Moreover, we were able to distinguish diffusion abnormalities related to altered
  intra-cortical tangential fibers from those associated with radial cortical fibers.
  Histological examinations revealed myelo-architectural abnormalities that explain
  the alterations observed through dMRI. The methods for dMRI acquisition and analysis
  used here are available in clinical settings and our work shows their clinical relevance
  to detect subtle cortical dysplasias through analysis of their microstructural properties.
