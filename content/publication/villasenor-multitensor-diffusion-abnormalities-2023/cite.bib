 abstract = {Focal cortical dysplasias are a type of malformations of cortical development that are a common cause of drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Surgical treatment is a viable option for some of these patients, with their outcome being highly related to complete surgical resection of lesions visible in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, subtle lesions often go undetected on conventional imaging. Several methods to analyze MRI have been proposed, with the common goal of rendering subtle cortical lesions visible. However, most image-processing methods are targeted to detect the macroscopic characteristics of cortical dysplasias, which do not always correspond to the microstructural disarrangement of these cortical malformations. Quantitative analysis of diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) enables the inference of tissue characteristics, and novel methods provide valuable microstructural features of complex tissue, including gray matter. We investigated the ability of advanced dMRI descriptors to detect diffusion abnormalities in an animal model of cortical dysplasia. For this purpose, we induced cortical dysplasia in 18 animals that were scanned at 30 postnatal days (along with 19 control animals). We obtained multi-shell dMRI, to which we fitted single and multi-tensor representations. Quantitative dMRI parameters derived from these methods were queried using a curvilinear coordinate system to sample the cortical mantle, providing inter-subject anatomical correspondence. We found region- and layer-specific diffusion abnormalities in experimental animals. Moreover, we were able to distinguish diffusion abnormalities related to altered intra-cortical tangential fibers from those associated with radial cortical fibers. Histological examinations revealed myelo-architectural abnormalities that explain the alterations observed through dMRI. The methods for dMRI acquisition and analysis used here are available in clinical settings and our work shows their clinical relevance to detect subtle cortical dysplasias through analysis of their microstructural properties.},
