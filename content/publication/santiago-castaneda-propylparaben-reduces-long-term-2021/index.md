abstract: "BACKGROUND: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), an important risk factor\
  \ for Alzheimer's disease, induces long-term hippocampal damage and hyperexcitability.\
  \ On the other hand, studies support that propylparaben (PPB) induces hippocampal\
  \ neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE: Experiments were designed\
  \ to evaluate the effects of subchronic treatment with PPB on TBI-induced changes\
  \ in the hippocampus of rats. METHODS: Severe TBI was induced using the lateral\
  \ fluid percussion model. Subsequently, rats received subchronic administration\
  \ with PPB (178$ $mg/kg, TBI+PPB) or vehicle (TBI+PEG) daily for 5 days. The following\
  \ changes were examined during the experimental procedure: sensorimotor dysfunction,\
  \ changes in hippocampal excitability, as well as neuronal damage and volume. RESULTS:\
  \ TBI+PEG group showed sensorimotor dysfunction (p$ < $0.001), hyperexcitability\
  \ (64.2%, p$ < $0.001), and low neuronal preservation ipsi- and contralateral to\
  \ the trauma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis revealed lower volume (17.2%;\
  \ p$ < $0.01) and great damage to the ipsilateral hippocampus. TBI+PPB group showed\
  \ sensorimotor dysfunction that was partially reversed 30 days after trauma. This\
  \ group showed hippocampal excitability and neuronal preservation similar to the\
  \ control group. However, MRI analysis revealed lower hippocampal volume (p$ < $0.05)\
  \ when compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: The present study confirms that\
  \ post-TBI subchronic administration with PPB reduces the long-term consequences\
  \ of trauma in the hippocampus. Implications of PPB as a neuroprotective strategy\
  \ to prevent the development of Alzheimer's disease as consequence of TBI are discussed."
