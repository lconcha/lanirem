abstract: This study developed a method to approximate the covariance
  matrix associated with the simulation of water molecular diffusion inside the brain
  tissue. The computation implements the Discontinuous Galerkin method of the diffusion
  equation. A physically consistent numerical flux is applied to model the interaction
  between the axon walls and extracellular regions. This numerical flux yields an
  efficient GPU-CUDA implementation. We consider the two-dimensional case of high
  axon pack density, valid, for instance, in the brain's corpus callosum
  region.
