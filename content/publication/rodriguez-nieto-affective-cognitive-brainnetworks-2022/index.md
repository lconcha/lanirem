abstract: Different theoretical models have proposed cognitive and affective components
  in empathy and moral judgments encompassing compassion. Furthermore, gender differences
  in psychological and neural functions involving empathic and moral processing, as
  well as compassionate experiences, have been reported. However, the neurobiological
  function regarding affective and cognitive integration underlying compassion and
  gender-associated differences has not been investigated. In this study, we aimed
  to examine the interaction between cognitive and emotional components through functional
  connectivity analyzes and to explore gender differences for the recruitment and
  interaction of these components. Thirty-six healthy participants (21–56 years; 21
  women) were exposed to social images in an fMRI session to judge whether the stimuli
  elicited compassion. The results showed a different connectivity pattern for women
  and men of the insular cortex, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), the orbitofrontal
  cortex (OFC), and the cingulate cortex. The integration of affective and cognitive
  components follows a complex functional connectivity pattern that is different for
  both genders. These differences may indicate that men largely make compassionate
  judgments based on contextual information, while women tend to notably take internal
  and introspective processes into account. Women and men can use different affective
  and cognitive routes that could converge in similar learning of moral values, empathic
  experiences and compassionate acts.
