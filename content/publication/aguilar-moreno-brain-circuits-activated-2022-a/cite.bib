 abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows obtaining anatomical and functional information of the brain in the same subject at different times. Manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) uses manganese ions to identify brain activity, although in high doses it might produce neurotoxic effects. Our aims were to identify a manganese dose that does not affect motivated behaviors such as sexual behavior, running wheel and the rotarod test. The second goal was to determine the optimal dose of chloride manganese (MnCl2) that will allow us to evaluate activation of brain regions after females mated controlling (pacing) the sexual interaction. To achieve that, two experiments were performed. In experiment 1 we evaluated the effects of two doses of MnCl2, 8 and 16 mg/kg. Subjects were injected with one of the doses of MnCl2 24 hours before the test on sessions 1, 5 and 10 and immediately thereafter scanned. Female sexual behavior, running wheel and the rotarod were evaluated once a week for 10 weeks. In experiment 2 we followed a similar procedure, but females paced the sexual interaction once a week for 10 weeks and were injected with one of the doses of MnCl2 24 hours before the test and immediately thereafter scanned on sessions 1, 5 and 10. The results of experiment 1 show that neither dose of MnCl2 induces alterations on sexual behavior, running wheel and rotarod. Experiment 2 demonstrated that MEMRI allow us to detect activation of different brain regions after sexual behavior, including the olfactory bulb (OB), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), the amygdala (AMG), the medial preoptic area (MPOA), the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), the striatum (STR) and the hippocampus (Hipp) allowing the identification of changes in brain circuits activated by sexual behavior. The socio sexual circuit showed a higher signal intensity on session 5 than the reward circuit and the control groups indicating that even with sexual experience the activation of the reward circuit requires the activation of the socio sexual circuit. Our study demonstrates that MEMRI can be used repeatedly in the same subject to evaluate the activation of brain circuits after motivated behaviors and how can this activation change with experience.},
