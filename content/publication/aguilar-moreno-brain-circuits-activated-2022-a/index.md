abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows obtaining anatomical and functional
  information of the brain in the same subject at different times. Manganese-enhanced
  MRI (MEMRI) uses manganese ions to identify brain activity, although in high doses
  it might produce neurotoxic effects. Our aims were to identify a manganese dose
  that does not affect motivated behaviors such as sexual behavior, running wheel
  and the rotarod test. The second goal was to determine the optimal dose of chloride
  manganese (MnCl2) that will allow us to evaluate activation of brain regions after
  females mated controlling (pacing) the sexual interaction. To achieve that, two
  experiments were performed. In experiment 1 we evaluated the effects of two doses
  of MnCl2, 8 and 16 mg/kg. Subjects were injected with one of the doses of MnCl2
  24 hours before the test on sessions 1, 5 and 10 and immediately thereafter scanned.
  Female sexual behavior, running wheel and the rotarod were evaluated once a week
  for 10 weeks. In experiment 2 we followed a similar procedure, but females paced
  the sexual interaction once a week for 10 weeks and were injected with one of the
  doses of MnCl2 24 hours before the test and immediately thereafter scanned on sessions
  1, 5 and 10. The results of experiment 1 show that neither dose of MnCl2 induces
  alterations on sexual behavior, running wheel and rotarod. Experiment 2 demonstrated
  that MEMRI allow us to detect activation of different brain regions after sexual
  behavior, including the olfactory bulb (OB), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
  (BNST), the amygdala (AMG), the medial preoptic area (MPOA), the ventromedial hypothalamus
  (VMH), the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), the striatum (STR) and the hippocampus (Hipp)
  allowing the identification of changes in brain circuits activated by sexual behavior.
  The socio sexual circuit showed a higher signal intensity on session 5 than the
  reward circuit and the control groups indicating that even with sexual experience
  the activation of the reward circuit requires the activation of the socio sexual
  circuit. Our study demonstrates that MEMRI can be used repeatedly in the same subject
  to evaluate the activation of brain circuits after motivated behaviors and how can
  this activation change with experience.
