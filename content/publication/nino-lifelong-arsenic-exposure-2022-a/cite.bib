 abstract = {Epidemiological studies demonstrate that arsenic exposure is associated with cognitive dysfunction. Experimental arsenic exposure models showed learning and memory deficits and molecular changes resembling the functional and pathologic neurodegeneration features. The present work focuses on hippocampal pathological changes in Wistar rats induced by continuous arsenic exposure from in utero up to 12~months of age, evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging along with immunohistochemistry. Diffusion-weighted images revealed age-related lower fractional anisotropy and higher radial-axial and mean diffusivity at 6 and 12~months, indicating that arsenic exposure leads to hippocampal demyelination. These structural alterations were paralleled by immunohistochemical changes that showed a significant loss of myelin basic protein in CA1 and CA3 regions accompanied by increased glial fibrillary acidic protein expression at all time-points studied. Concomitantly, arsenic exposure induced an altered morphology of astrocytes at all studied ages, whereas increased synaptogenesis was only observed at two months of age. These results suggest that environmental arsenic exposure is linked to impaired hippocampal connectivity and perhaps early glial senescence, which together might resemble a premature aging phenomenon leading to cognitive deficits.},
