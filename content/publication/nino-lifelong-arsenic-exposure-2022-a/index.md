abstract: Epidemiological studies demonstrate that arsenic exposure is associated
  with cognitive dysfunction. Experimental arsenic exposure models showed learning
  and memory deficits and molecular changes resembling the functional and pathologic
  neurodegeneration features. The present work focuses on hippocampal pathological
  changes in Wistar rats induced by continuous arsenic exposure from in utero up to
  12~months of age, evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging along with immunohistochemistry.
  Diffusion-weighted images revealed age-related lower fractional anisotropy and higher
  radial-axial and mean diffusivity at 6 and 12~months, indicating that arsenic exposure
  leads to hippocampal demyelination. These structural alterations were paralleled
  by immunohistochemical changes that showed a significant loss of myelin basic protein
  in CA1 and CA3 regions accompanied by increased glial fibrillary acidic protein
  expression at all time-points studied. Concomitantly, arsenic exposure induced an
  altered morphology of astrocytes at all studied ages, whereas increased synaptogenesis
  was only observed at two months of age. These results suggest that environmental
  arsenic exposure is linked to impaired hippocampal connectivity and perhaps early
  glial senescence, which together might resemble a premature aging phenomenon leading
  to cognitive deficits.
