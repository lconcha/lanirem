abstract: 'Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a substance use disorder (SUD) characterized
  by compulsion to seek, use and abuse of cocaine, with severe health and economic
  consequences for the patients, their families and society. Due to the lack of successful
  treatments and high relapse rate, more research is needed to understand this and
  other SUD. Here, we present the SUDMEX CONN dataset, a Mexican open dataset of 74
  CUD patients (9 female) and matched 64 healthy controls (6 female) that includes
  demographic, cognitive, clinical, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. MRI
  data includes: 1) structural (T1-weighted), 2) multishell high-angular resolution
  diffusion-weighted (DWI-HARDI) and 3) functional (resting state fMRI) sequences.
  The repository contains unprocessed MRI data available in brain imaging data structure
  (BIDS) format with corresponding metadata available at the OpenNeuro data sharing
  platform. Researchers can pursue brain variability between these groups or use a
  single group for a larger population sample.'
