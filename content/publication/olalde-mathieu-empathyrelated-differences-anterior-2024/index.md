abstract: It has been reported that cannabis consumption affects the anterior cingulate
  cortex (ACC), a structure with a central role in mediating the empathic response.
  In this study, we compared psychometric scores of empathy subscales, between a group
  of regular cannabis users (85, users) and a group of non-consumers (51, controls).
  We found that users have a greater Emotional Comprehension, a cognitive empathy
  trait involving the understanding of the ``other'' emotional state. Resting state
  functional MRI in a smaller sample (users = 46, controls = 34) allowed to identify
  greater functional connectivity (FC) of the ACC with the left somatomotor cortex
  (SMC), in users when compared to controls. These differences were also evident within
  the empathy core network, where users showed greater within network FC. The greater
  FC showed by the users is associated with emotional representational areas and empathy-related
  regions. In addition, the differences in psychometric scores suggest that users
  have more empathic comprehension. These findings suggest a potential association
  between cannabis use, a greater comprehension of the other's affective state and
  the functional brain organization of the users. However, further research is needed
  to explore such association, since many other factors may be at play.
