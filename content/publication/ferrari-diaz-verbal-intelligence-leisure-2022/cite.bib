 abstract = {Cognitive reserve (CR) is the adaptability of cognitive processes that helps to explain differences in the susceptibility of cognitive or daily functions to resist the onslaught of brain-related injury or the normal aging process. The underlying brain mechanisms of CR studied through electroencephalogram (EEG) are scarcely reported. To our knowledge, few studies have considered a combination of exclusively dynamic proxy measures of CR. We evaluated the association of CR with cognition and resting-state EEG in older adults using three of the most frequently used dynamic proxy measures of CR: verbal intelligence, leisure activities, and physical activities. Multiple linear regression analyses with the CR proxies as independent variables and cognitive performance and the absolute power (AP) on six resting-state EEG components (beta, alpha1, alpha2, gamma, theta, and delta) as outcomes were performed. Eighty-eight healthy older adults aged 60–77 (58 female) were selected from previous study data. Verbal intelligence was a significant positive predictor of perceptual organization, working memory, processing speed, executive functions, and central delta power. Leisure activities were a significant positive predictor of posterior alpha2 power. The dynamic proxy variables of CR are differently associated with cognitive performance and resting-state EEG. Implementing leisure activities and tasks to increase vocabulary may promote better cognitive performance through compensation or neural efficiency mechanisms.},
