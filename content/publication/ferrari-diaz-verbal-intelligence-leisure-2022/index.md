abstract: 'Cognitive reserve (CR) is the adaptability of cognitive processes that
  helps to explain differences in the susceptibility of cognitive or daily functions
  to resist the onslaught of brain-related injury or the normal aging process. The
  underlying brain mechanisms of CR studied through electroencephalogram (EEG) are
  scarcely reported. To our knowledge, few studies have considered a combination of
  exclusively dynamic proxy measures of CR. We evaluated the association of CR with
  cognition and resting-state EEG in older adults using three of the most frequently
  used dynamic proxy measures of CR: verbal intelligence, leisure activities, and
  physical activities. Multiple linear regression analyses with the CR proxies as
  independent variables and cognitive performance and the absolute power (AP) on six
  resting-state EEG components (beta, alpha1, alpha2, gamma, theta, and delta) as
  outcomes were performed. Eighty-eight healthy older adults aged 60–77 (58 female)
  were selected from previous study data. Verbal intelligence was a significant positive
  predictor of perceptual organization, working memory, processing speed, executive
  functions, and central delta power. Leisure activities were a significant positive
  predictor of posterior alpha2 power. The dynamic proxy variables of CR are differently
  associated with cognitive performance and resting-state EEG. Implementing leisure
  activities and tasks to increase vocabulary may promote better cognitive performance
  through compensation or neural efficiency mechanisms.'
