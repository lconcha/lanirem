abstract: 'Interpretation of the neural findings of deception without considering
  the ecological validity of the experimental tasks could lead to biased conclusions.
  In this study we classified the experimental tasks according to their inclusion
  of three essential components required for ecological validity: intention to lie,
  social interaction and motivation. First, we carried out a systematic review to
  categorize fMRI deception tasks and to weigh the degree of ecological validity of
  each one. Second, we performed a meta-analysis to identify if each type of task
  involves a different neural substrate and to distinguish the neurocognitive contribution
  of each component of ecological validity essential to deception. We detected six
  categories of deception tasks. Intention to lie was the component least frequently
  included, followed by social interaction. Monetary reward was the most frequent
  motivator. The results of the meta-analysis, including 59 contrasts, revealed that
  intention to lie is associated with activation in the left lateral occipital cortex
  (superior division) whereas the left angular gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus
  (IFG) are engaged during lying under instructions. Additionally, the right IFG appears
  to participate in the social aspect of lying including simulated and real interactions.
  We found no effect of monetary reward in our analysis. Finally, tasks with high
  ecological validity recruited fewer brain areas (right insular cortex and bilateral
  anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)) compared to less ecological tasks, perhaps because
  they are more natural and realistic, and engage a wide network of brain mechanisms,
  as opposed to specific tasks that demand more centralized processes.'
