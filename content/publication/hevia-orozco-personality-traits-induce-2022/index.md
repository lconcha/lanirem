abstract: This paper shows the brain correlates of Cloninger's personality model during
  the presentation of social scenarios under positive or negative valence situations.
  Social scenarios were constructed when participants played the Dictator game with
  two confederates that had two opposites roles as the cooperator (Coop) and non-cooperator
  (NoCoop). Later the same day during a fMRI scanning session, participants read negative
  (Neg) and positive (Pos) situations that happened to confederates in the past. Participants
  were asked to think ``how do you think those people felt during that situation?''
  A dissimilarity matrix between stimuli were obtained from fMRI results. Results
  shown that Harm Avoidance trait people make use of right middle frontal gyrus and
  left superior frontal gyrus to discriminate between Coop and NoCoop. Cooperation
  as a trait makes use of the right superior temporal gyrus and the right precuneus
  to discriminate between Coop and NoCoop in positive social scenarios. Finally, Self-directedness
  trait people make use of the right inferior parietal lobe to discriminate between
  Coop and NoCoop in negative social scenarios and the right precuneus to discriminate
  between Coop and Strangers. An intuitive link between discrimination findings and
  behavioral patterns of those personality traits is proposed.
