abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently gained popularity across different
  medical fields to aid in the detection of diseases based on pathology samples or
  medical imaging findings. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a key assessment
  tool for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The role of machine learning
  and artificial intelligence to increase detection of brain abnormalities in TLE
  remains inconclusive. We used support vector machine (SV) and deep learning (DL)
  models based on region of interest (ROI-based) structural (n~=~336) and diffusion
  (n~=~863) brain MRI data from patients with TLE with (\"lesional\") and without
  (\"non-lesional\") radiographic features suggestive of underlying hippocampal sclerosis
  from the multinational (multi-center) ENIGMA-Epilepsy consortium. Our data showed
  that models to identify TLE performed better or similar (68-75%) compared to models
  to lateralize the side of TLE (56-73%, except structural-based) based on diffusion
  data with the opposite pattern seen for structural data (67-75% to diagnose vs.
  83% to lateralize). In other aspects, structural and diffusion-based models showed
  similar classification accuracies. Our classification models for patients with hippocampal
  sclerosis were more accurate (68-76%) than models that stratified non-lesional patients
  (53-62%). Overall, SV and DL models performed similarly with several instances in
  which SV mildly outperformed DL. We discuss the relative performance of these models
  with ROI-level data and the implications for future applications of machine learning
  and artificial intelligence in epilepsy care.
