 abstractnote = {Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is widely used to infer microstructural characteristics of tissue, particularly in cerebral white matter. Histological validation of the metrics derived from dMRI methods are needed to fully characterize their ability to capture biologically-relevant histological features non-invasively. The data described here were used to correlate metrics derived from dMRI and quantitative histology in an animal model of axonal degeneration (“Histological validation of per-bundle water diffusion metrics within a region of fiber crossing following axonal degeneration” [1]). Unilateral retinal ischemia/reperfusion was induced in 10 rats, by the elevation of pressure of the anterior chamber of the eye for 90 min. Five rats were used as controls. After five weeks, injured animals were intracardially perfused to analyze the optic nerves and chiasm with dMRI and histology. This resulted in 15 brain scans, each with 80 diffusion-sensitizing gradient directions with b = 2000 and 2500 s/mm2 and 20 non-diffusion-weighted images (b = 0 s/mm2), with isometric voxel resolution of 125 μm3. Histological sections were obtained after dMRI. Optical microscopy photomicrographs of the optic nerves (stained with toluidine blue) are available, as well as their corresponding automatic segmentations of axons and myelin.},
