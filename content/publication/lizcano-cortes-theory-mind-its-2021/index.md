abstract: Is brain structure related to function? Can one predict the other? These
  are questions that are still waiting to be answered definitively. In this paper
  we seek to investigate these questions, in particular, we are interested in the
  relation between brain structure and theory of mind (ToM). ToM is defined as the
  ability to attribute mental states to others. Previous studies have observed correlations
  between performance on ToM tasks, and gray-matter size/volume in dorsomedial prefrontal
  cortex (dmPFC), temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and precuneus (PCu). Despite these
  findings, there are concerns about false positive results and replicability issues.
  In this study we used two different tasks to evaluate ToM, Reading the Mind in the
  Eyes Test (RMET), and the Short Story Task (SST). Performance in these tasks was
  correlated to brain anatomy measures including voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and
  cortical thickness (CT) analysis, from ninety-one neurotypical participants. High-resolution
  structural brain images were acquired, and whole-brain and region of interest (ROI)
  analyses were implemented. The analyses did not show statistically significant associations
  between ToM performance and brain structural measures after correction. Significant
  associations between performance on ToM tests and a widespread array of regions
  loosely associated with ToM were observed only for whole brain uncorrected analysis
  (p $<$ 0.001). These results do not replicate a previous study with neurotypical
  participants. We tested two different ToM tests, two different softwares for VBM
  and CT, and we used two samples, one with 91 and a sub-sample with 69 participants.
  Neither of these conditions made a difference in the results obtained. Consequently,
  these results suggest that if the population is neurotypical and homogenous, it
  is unlikely that a reliable association between brain anatomy measures and ToM performance,
  as measured with these tasks, may be found.
