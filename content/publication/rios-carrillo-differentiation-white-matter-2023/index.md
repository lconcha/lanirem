abstract: 'Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is a non-invasive
  technique that is sensitive to microstructural geometry in neural tissue and is
  useful for the detection of neuropathology in research and clinical settings. Tensor-valued
  diffusion encoding schemes (b-tensor) have been developed to enrich the microstructural
  data that can be obtained through DW-MRI. These advanced methods have proven to
  be more specific to microstructural properties than conventional DW-MRI acquisitions.
  Additionally, machine learning methods are particularly useful for the study of
  multidimensional data sets. In this work, we have tested the reach of b-tensor encoding
  data analyses with machine learning in different histopathological scenarios. We
  achieved this in three steps: 1) We induced different levels of white matter damage
  in rodent optic nerves. 2) We obtained ex vivo DW-MRI data with b-tensor encoding
  schemes and calculated quantitative metrics using Q-space trajectory imaging. 3)
  We used a machine learning model to identify the main contributing features and
  built a voxel-wise probabilistic classification map of histological damage. Our
  results show that this model is sensitive to characteristics of microstructural
  damage. In conclusion, b-tensor encoded DW-MRI data analyzed with machine learning
  methods, have the potential to be further developed for the detection of histopathology
  and neurodegeneration.'
