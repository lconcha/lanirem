 abstractnote = {Hormones and Behavior was first published 50 years ago including some articles related to the hormonal regulation of sexual behavior in different species. Since then, this research field has produced outstanding discoveries that have contributed to our understanding of the control of sexual behavior. The refinement of classical techniques and the development of new experimental tools has opened the door to a new era of research that will allow us to understand different aspects of sexual behavior. It would also expand the possible extrapolation from animal models to understand human sexuality and its dysfunctions. In this review, we summarize some of the most recent findings about sexual behavior in both sexes including the refinement of classical methods of study with new approaches and questions as well as the development of new methods trying to explain mechanisms of action on motivational and consummatory elements of mating behavior. We also reviewed other aspects that modulate sexual behavior such as attractivity, olfactory signals and learning which model mate selection. Additionally, we described studies demonstrating that sexual behavior induces permanent brain modifications in neuronal circuits. Finally, we briefly describe recent contributions on animal models of human sexuality dysfunctions which, although with their own limitations, are under continuous refining.},
