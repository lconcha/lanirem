abstract: The ability to perceive and produce movements in the real world with precise
  timing is critical for survival in animals, including humans. However, research
  on sensorimotor timing has rarely considered the tight interrelation between perception,
  action, and cognition. In this review, we present new evidence from behavioral,
  computational, and neural studies in humans and nonhuman primates, suggesting a
  pivotal link between sensorimotor control and temporal processing, as well as describing
  new theoretical frameworks regarding timing in perception and action. We first discuss
  the link between movement coordination and interval-based timing by addressing how
  motor training develops accurate spatiotemporal patterns in behavior and influences
  the perception of temporal intervals. We then discuss how motor expertise results
  from establishing task-relevant neural manifolds in sensorimotor cortical areas
  and how the geometry and dynamics of these manifolds help reduce timing variability.
  We also highlight how neural dynamics in sensorimotor areas are involved in beat-based
  timing. These lines of research aim to extend our understanding of how timing arises
  from and contributes to perceptual-motor behaviors in complex environments to seamlessly
  interact with other cognitive processes.
