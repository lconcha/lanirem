abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Recent work has shown that people with common epilepsies have
  characteristic patterns of cortical thinning, and that these changes may be progressive
  over time. Leveraging a large multicenter cross-sectional cohort, we investigated
  whether regional morphometric changes occur in a sequential manner, and whether
  these changes in people with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis
  (MTLE-HS) correlate with clinical features. METHODS: We extracted regional measures
  of cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical brain volumes from T1-weighted
  (T1W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans collected by the ENIGMA-Epilepsy consortium,
  comprising 804 people with MTLE-HS and 1625 healthy controls from 25 centers. Features
  with a moderate case-control effect size (Cohen d,$≥$,.5) were used to train an
  event-based model (EBM), which estimates a sequence of disease-specific biomarker
  changes from cross-sectional data and assigns a biomarker-based fine-grained disease
  stage to individual patients. We tested for associations between EBM disease stage
  and duration of epilepsy, age at onset, and antiseizure medicine (ASM) resistance.
  RESULTS: In MTLE-HS, decrease in ipsilateral hippocampal volume along with increased
  asymmetry in hippocampal volume was followed by reduced thickness in neocortical
  regions, reduction in ipsilateral thalamus volume, and finally, increase in ipsilateral
  lateral ventricle volume. EBM stage was correlated with duration of illness (Spearman
  $h̊o$,=~.293, p~=~7.03,×,10-16 ), age at onset ($o̊$,=,-.18, p,=~9.82,×,10-7 ),
  and ASM resistance (area under the curve~=~.59, p~=~.043, Mann-Whitney U test).
  However, associations were driven by cases assigned to EBM Stage 0, which represents
  MTLE-HS with mild or nondetectable abnormality on T1W MRI. SIGNIFICANCE: From cross-sectional
  MRI, we reconstructed a disease progression model that highlights a sequence of
  MRI changes that aligns with previous longitudinal studies. This model could be
  used to stage MTLE-HS subjects in other cohorts and help establish connections between
  imaging-based progression staging and clinical features.'
