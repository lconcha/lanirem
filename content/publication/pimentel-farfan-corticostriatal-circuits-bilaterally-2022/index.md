abstract: Movement initiation and control require the orchestrated activity of sensorimotor
  cortical and subcortical regions. However, the exact contribution of specific pathways
  and interactions to the final behavioral outcome are still under debate. Here, by
  combining structural lesions, pathway-specific optogenetic manipulations and freely
  moving electrophysiological recordings in rats, we studied cortico-striatal interactions
  in the context of forelimb bilaterally coordinated movements. We provide evidence
  indicating that bilateral actions are initiated by motor cortical regions where
  intratelencephalic bilateral cortico-striatal (bcs-IT) projections recruit the sensorimotor
  striatum to provide stability and duration to already commanded bilateral movements.
  Furthermore, striatal spiking activity was correlated with movement duration and
  kinematic parameters of the execution. bcs-IT stimulation affected only the representation
  of movement duration but spared that of kinematics. Our findings confirm the modular
  organization of information processing in the striatum and its involvement in moment-to-moment
  movement control but not initiation or selection.
