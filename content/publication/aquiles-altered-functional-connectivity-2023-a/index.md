abstract: Focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) are malformations of cortical development
  that often result in medically refractory epilepsy, with a greater incidence in
  the pediatric population. The relationship between the disturbed cortical morphology
  and epileptogenic activity of FCDs remains unclear. We used the BCNU (carmustine
  1-3-bis-chloroethyl-nitrosourea) animal model of cortical dysplasia to evaluate
  neuronal and laminar alterations and how these result in altered activity of intracortical
  networks in early life. We corroborated the previously reported morphological anomalies
  characteristic of the BCNU model, comprising slightly larger and rounder neurons
  and abnormal cortical lamination. Next, the neuronal activity of live cortical slices
  was evaluated through large field-of-view calcium imaging as well as the neuronal
  response to a stimulus that leads to cortical hyperexcitability (pilocarpine). Examination
  of the joint activity of neuronal calcium time series allowed us to identify intracortical
  communication patterns and their response to pilocarpine. The baseline power density
  distribution of neurons in the cortex of BCNU-treated animals was different from
  that of control animals, with the former showing no modulation after stimulus. Moreover,
  the intracortical communication pattern differed between the two groups, with cortexes
  from BCNU-treated animals displaying decreased inter-layer connectivity as compared
  to control animals. Our results indicate that the altered anatomical organization
  of the cortex of BCNU-treated rats translates into altered functional networks that
  respond abnormally to a hyperexcitable stimulus and highlight the role of network
  dysfunction in the pathophysiology of cortical dysplasia.
