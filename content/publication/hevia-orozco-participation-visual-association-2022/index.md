abstract: "During a social evaluation, the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ)\
  \ plays an important role according to its contribution in making inferences about\
  \ the mental states of others. However, what is the neural response if rTPJ function\
  \ is inhibited during a mentalizing task? In this study, participants played the\
  \ Dictator Game with two confederates: one playing cooperation (C) and other playing\
  \ non-cooperation (NC) role and then they were scanned during a mentalizing test.\
  \ However, we inhibited rTPJ using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) after\
  \ they played the game and before they were scanned. In this test, participants\
  \ read negative (Neg) or positive (Pos) personal situations and then they watched\
  \ confederate's pictures. Images from the TMS group were compared against controls\
  \ with no TMS stimulation. After statistical comparison, we found a significantly\
  \ higher activity in right and left visual association areas (BA 18) during the\
  \ NCPos $>$ NCNeg condition in the TMS group compared with the No-TMS group. Same\
  \ visual association areas have been described before when participants are processing\
  \ visual emotional information or when making a fast social categorization. This\
  \ could reflect a neural mechanism of socio - emotional categorization that emerges\
  \ after rTPJ inhibition."
