 abstract = {Prenatal programming during pregnancy sets physiological outcomes in the offspring by integrating external or internal stimuli. Accordingly, pregnancy is an important stage of physiological adaptations to the environment where the fetus becomes exposed and adapted to the maternal milieu. Maternal exposure to high-energy dense diets can affect motivated behavior in the offspring leading to addiction and impaired sociability. A high-energy dense exposure also increases the pro-inflammatory cytokines profile in plasma and brain and favors microglia activation in the offspring. While still under investigation, prenatal exposure to high-energy dense diets promotes structural abnormalities in selective brain regions regulating motivation and social behavior in the offspring. The current review addresses the role of energy-dense foods programming central and peripheral inflammatory profiles during embryonic development and its effect on motivated behavior in the offspring. We provide preclinical and clinical evidence that supports the contribution of prenatal programming in shaping immune profiles that favor structural and brain circuit disruption leading to aberrant motivated behaviors after birth. We hope this minireview encourages future research on novel insights into the mechanisms underlying maternal programming of motivated behavior by central immune networks.},
