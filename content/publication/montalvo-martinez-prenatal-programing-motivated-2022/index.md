abstract: Prenatal programming during pregnancy sets physiological outcomes in the
  offspring by integrating external or internal stimuli. Accordingly, pregnancy is
  an important stage of physiological adaptations to the environment where the fetus
  becomes exposed and adapted to the maternal milieu. Maternal exposure to high-energy
  dense diets can affect motivated behavior in the offspring leading to addiction
  and impaired sociability. A high-energy dense exposure also increases the pro-inflammatory
  cytokines profile in plasma and brain and favors microglia activation in the offspring.
  While still under investigation, prenatal exposure to high-energy dense diets promotes
  structural abnormalities in selective brain regions regulating motivation and social
  behavior in the offspring. The current review addresses the role of energy-dense
  foods programming central and peripheral inflammatory profiles during embryonic
  development and its effect on motivated behavior in the offspring. We provide preclinical
  and clinical evidence that supports the contribution of prenatal programming in
  shaping immune profiles that favor structural and brain circuit disruption leading
  to aberrant motivated behaviors after birth. We hope this minireview encourages
  future research on novel insights into the mechanisms underlying maternal programming
  of motivated behavior by central immune networks.
