abstract: "Background: Preterm birth is one of the world's critical health problems,\
  \ with an incidence of 5% to 18% of living newborns according to various countries.\
  \ White matter injuries due to preoligodendrocytes deficits cause hypomyelination\
  \ in children born preterm. Preterm infants also have multiple neurodevelopmental\
  \ sequelae due to prenatal and perinatal risk factors for brain damage. The purpose\
  \ of this work was to explore the effects of the brain risk factors and MRI volumes\
  \ and abnormalities on the posterior motor and cognitive development at 3 years\
  \ of age. Methods: A total of 166 preterm infants were examined before 4 months\
  \ and clinical and MRI evaluations were performed. MRI showed abnormal findings\
  \ in 89% of the infants. Parents of all infants were invited to receive the Katona\
  \ neurohabilitation treatment. The parents of 128 infants accepted and received\
  \ Katona's neurohabilitation treatment. The remaining 38 infants did not receive\
  \ treatment for a variety of reasons. At the three-year follow-up, Bayley's II Mental\
  \ Developmental Index (MDI) and the Psychomotor Developmental Index (PDI) were compared\
  \ between treated and untreated subjects. Results: The treated children had higher\
  \ values of both indices than the untreated. Linear regression showed that the antecedents\
  \ of placenta disorders and sepsis as well as volumes of the corpus callosum and\
  \ of the left lateral ventricle significantly predicted both MDI and PDI, while\
  \ Apgar $<$ 7 and volume of the right lateral ventricle predicted the PDI. Conclusions:\
  \ (1) The results indicate that preterm infants who received Katona's neurohabilitation\
  \ procedure exhibited significantly better outcomes at 3 years of age compared to\
  \ those who did not receive the treatment. (2) The presence of sepsis and the volumes\
  \ of the corpus callosum and lateral ventricles at 3–4 months were significant predictors\
  \ of the outcome at 3 years of age."
