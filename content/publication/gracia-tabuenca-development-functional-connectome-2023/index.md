abstract: Adolescence is a crucial developmental period in terms of behavior and mental
  health. Therefore, understanding how the brain develops during this stage is a fundamental
  challenge for neuroscience. Recent studies have modeled the brain as a network or
  connectome, mainly applying measures from graph theory, showing a change in its
  functional organization, such as an increase in its segregation and integration.
  Topological Data Analysis (TDA) complements such modeling by extracting high-dimensional
  features across the whole range of connectivity values instead of exploring a fixed
  set of connections. This study inquires into the developmental trajectories of such
  properties using a longitudinal sample of typically developing human participants
  (N = 98; 53/45 female/male; 6.7–18.1 years), applying TDA to their functional connectomes.
  In addition, we explore the effect of puberty on individual developmental trajectories.
  Results showed that the adolescent brain has a more distributed topology structure
  compared with random networks but is more densely connected at the local level.
  Furthermore, developmental effects showed nonlinear trajectories for the topology
  of the whole brain and fronto-parietal networks, with an inflection point and increasing
  trajectories after puberty onset. These results add to the insights into the development
  of the functional organization of the adolescent brain.
