abstract: Intralaminar thalamic nuclei, including the central medial nucleus (CMT),
  have been classically implicated in the control of attentional functional states
  such as sleep-wake transitions. In rodents, the CMT innervates large cortical and
  subcortical areas bilaterally, including sensorimotor regions of the cortex and
  striatum, but its contribution to motor function, which regularly develops in faster
  temporal scales than attentional states, is still far from being completely understood.
  Here, by using a novel behavioral protocol to evaluate bilateral coordination in
  rats, combined with electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic manipulations,
  we studied the contribution of the CMT to motor control and coordination. We found
  that optogenetic stimulation of the central region of the CMT produced bilateral
  recruitment of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum. The same
  type of stimulations produced a significant increase in bilateral movement coordination
  of the forelimbs accompanied by a decrease in movement trajectory variability. Optogenetic
  inactivation of the CMT did not affect motor execution but significantly increased
  execution times, suggesting less interest in the task. Altogether, our results indicate
  that brief CMT activations create windows of synchronized bilateral cortico-striatal
  activity, suitable to facilitate motor coordination in temporal scales relevant
  for motor execution.
