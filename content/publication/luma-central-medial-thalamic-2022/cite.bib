 abstract = {Intralaminar thalamic nuclei, including the central medial nucleus (CMT), have been classically implicated in the control of attentional functional states such as sleep-wake transitions. In rodents, the CMT innervates large cortical and subcortical areas bilaterally, including sensorimotor regions of the cortex and striatum, but its contribution to motor function, which regularly develops in faster temporal scales than attentional states, is still far from being completely understood. Here, by using a novel behavioral protocol to evaluate bilateral coordination in rats, combined with electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic manipulations, we studied the contribution of the CMT to motor control and coordination. We found that optogenetic stimulation of the central region of the CMT produced bilateral recruitment of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum. The same type of stimulations produced a significant increase in bilateral movement coordination of the forelimbs accompanied by a decrease in movement trajectory variability. Optogenetic inactivation of the CMT did not affect motor execution but significantly increased execution times, suggesting less interest in the task. Altogether, our results indicate that brief CMT activations create windows of synchronized bilateral cortico-striatal activity, suitable to facilitate motor coordination in temporal scales relevant for motor execution.},
