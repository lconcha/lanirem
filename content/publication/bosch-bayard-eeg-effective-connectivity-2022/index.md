abstract: 'Introduction The maturation of electroencephalogram (EEG) effective connectivity
  in healthy infants during the first year of life is described. Methods Participants:
  A cross-sectional sample of 125 healthy at-term infants, from 0 to 12 months of
  age, underwent EEG in a state of quiet sleep. Procedures: The EEG primary currents
  at the source were described with the sLoreta method. An unmixing algorithm was
  applied to reduce the leakage, and the isolated effective coherence, a direct and
  directed measurement of information flow, was calculated. Results and Discussion
  Initially, the highest indices of connectivity are at the subcortical nuclei, continuing
  to the parietal lobe, predominantly the right hemisphere, then expanding to temporal,
  occipital, and finally the frontal areas, which is consistent with the myelination
  process. Age-related connectivity changes were mostly long-range and bilateral.
  Connections increased with age, mainly in the right hemisphere, while they mainly
  decreased in the left hemisphere. Increased connectivity from 20 to 30~Hz, mostly
  at the right hemisphere. These findings were consistent with right hemisphere predominance
  during the first three years of life. Theta and alpha connections showed the greatest
  changes with age. Strong connectivity was found between the parietal, temporal,
  and occipital regions to the frontal lobes, responsible for executive functions
  and consistent with behavioral development during the first year. The thalamus exchanges
  information bidirectionally with all cortical regions and frequency bands. Conclusions
  The maturation of EEG connectivity during the first year in healthy infants is very
  consistent with synaptogenesis, reductions in synaptogenesis, myelination, and functional
  and behavioral development.'
