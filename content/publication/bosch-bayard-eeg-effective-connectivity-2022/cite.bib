 abstract = {Introduction The maturation of electroencephalogram (EEG) effective connectivity in healthy infants during the first year of life is described. Methods Participants: A cross-sectional sample of 125 healthy at-term infants, from 0 to 12 months of age, underwent EEG in a state of quiet sleep. Procedures: The EEG primary currents at the source were described with the sLoreta method. An unmixing algorithm was applied to reduce the leakage, and the isolated effective coherence, a direct and directed measurement of information flow, was calculated. Results and Discussion Initially, the highest indices of connectivity are at the subcortical nuclei, continuing to the parietal lobe, predominantly the right hemisphere, then expanding to temporal, occipital, and finally the frontal areas, which is consistent with the myelination process. Age-related connectivity changes were mostly long-range and bilateral. Connections increased with age, mainly in the right hemisphere, while they mainly decreased in the left hemisphere. Increased connectivity from 20 to 30~Hz, mostly at the right hemisphere. These findings were consistent with right hemisphere predominance during the first three years of life. Theta and alpha connections showed the greatest changes with age. Strong connectivity was found between the parietal, temporal, and occipital regions to the frontal lobes, responsible for executive functions and consistent with behavioral development during the first year. The thalamus exchanges information bidirectionally with all cortical regions and frequency bands. Conclusions The maturation of EEG connectivity during the first year in healthy infants is very consistent with synaptogenesis, reductions in synaptogenesis, myelination, and functional and behavioral development.},
