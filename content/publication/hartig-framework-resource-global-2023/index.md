abstract: As science and technology evolve, there is an increasing need for promotion
  of international scientific exchange. Collaborations, while offering substantial
  opportunities for scientists and benefit to society, also present challenges for
  those working with animal models, such as non-human primates (NHPs). Diversity in
  regulation of animal research is sometimes mistaken for the absence of common international
  welfare standards. Here, the ethical and regulatory protocols for 13 countries that
  have guidelines in place for biomedical research involving NHPs were assessed with
  a focus on neuroscience. Review of the variability and similarity in trans-national
  NHP welfare regulations extended to countries in Asia, Europe and North America.
  A tabulated resource was established to advance solution-oriented discussions and
  scientific collaborations across borders. Our aim is to better inform the public
  and other stakeholders. Through cooperative efforts to identify and analyze information
  with reference to evidence-based discussion, the proposed key ingredients may help
  to shape and support a more informed, open framework. This framework and resource
  can be expanded further for biomedical research in other countries.
