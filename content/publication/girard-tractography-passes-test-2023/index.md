abstract: Estimating structural connectivity from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
  imaging is a challenging task, partly due to the presence of false-positive connections
  and the misestimation of connection weights. Building on previous efforts, the MICCAI-CDMRI
  Diffusion-Simulated Connectivity (DiSCo) challenge was carried out to evaluate state-of-the-art
  connectivity methods using novel large-scale numerical phantoms. The diffusion signal
  for the phantoms was obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. The results of the challenge
  suggest that methods selected by the 14 teams participating in the challenge can
  provide high correlations between estimated and ground-truth connectivity weights,
  in complex numerical environments. Additionally, the methods used by the participating
  teams were able to accurately identify the binary connectivity of the numerical
  dataset. However, specific false positive and false negative connections were consistently
  estimated across all methods. Although the challenge dataset doesn't capture the
  complexity of a real brain, it provided unique data with known macrostructure and
  microstructure ground-truth properties to facilitate the development of connectivity
  estimation methods.
