 abstractnote = {We describe a set of perivascular interneurons (PINs) with series of fibro-vesicular complexes (FVCs) throughout the gray matter of the adult rabbit and rat brains. PIN-FVCs are ubiquitous throughout the brain vasculature as detected in Golgi-impregnated specimens. Most PINs are small, aspiny cells with short or long (> 1 mm) axons that split and travel along arterial blood vessels. Upon ramification, axons form FVCs around the arising vascular branches; then, paired axons run parallel to the vessel wall until another ramification ensues, and a new FVC is formed. Cytologically, FVCs consist of clusters of perivascular bulbs (PVBs) encircling the precapillary and capillary wall surrounded by end-feet and the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells and pericytes. A PVB contains mitochondria, multivesicular bodies, and granules with a membranous core, similar to Meissner corpuscles and other mechanoreceptors. Some PVBs form asymmetrical, axo-spinous synapses with presumptive adjacent neurons. PINs appear to correspond to the type 1 nNOS-positive neurons whose FVCs co-label with markers of sensory fiber-terminals surrounded by astrocytic end-feet. The PIN is conserved in adult cats and rhesus monkey specimens. The location, ubiquity throughout the vasculature of the mammalian brain, and cytological organization of the PIN-FVCs suggests that it is a sensory receptor intrinsic to the mammalian neurovascular unit that corresponds to an afferent limb of the sensorimotor feed-back mechanism controlling local blood flow.},
