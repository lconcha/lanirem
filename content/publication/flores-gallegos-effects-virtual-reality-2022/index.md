abstract: Reading is a complex cognitive process that requires multisensory processing,
  graphical phonological codification, short- and long-term memory, executive functions,
  and motor and cognitive responses. Children with reading learning disability (RLD)
  show a specific deficit in learning to read, along with motor, rhythmic and visual
  difficulties. The present exploratory research aims to observe the effects of a
  virtual reality game training program on reading performance (accuracy, speed, and
  comprehension), visual attention, motor balance, and coordination in children with
  RLD in an experimental study by comparing two groups (experimental and control)
  of children. The game was developed by the authors and incorporates a commercial
  game ``BeatSaber'' and a specific design game ``GrafoTami''. The results showed
  that the training program induced a significant effect on visual attention task
  scores and movement speed in two balance tasks for participants in the experimental
  group, while participants in the control group did not show any changes. Although
  no significant changes in reading performance were observed, the high magnitude
  effect size suggested that changes in reading performance would likely become significant
  with a larger number of participants, and the same was true for physical self-perception
  and happiness self-perception, which are areas of self-perception.
