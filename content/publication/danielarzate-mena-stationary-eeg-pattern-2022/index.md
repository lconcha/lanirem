abstract: Relating brain dynamics acting on time scales that differ by at least an
  order of magnitude is a fundamental issue in brain research. The same is true for
  the observation of stable dynamical structures in otherwise highly non-stationary
  signals. The present study addresses both problems by the analysis of simultaneous
  resting state EEG-fMRI recordings of 53 patients with epilepsy. Confirming previous
  findings, we observe a generic and temporally stable average correlation pattern
  in EEG recordings. We design a predictor for the General Linear Model describing
  fluctuations around the stationary EEG correlation pattern and detect resting state
  networks in fMRI data. The acquired statistical maps are contrasted to several surrogate
  tests and compared with maps derived by spatial Independent Component Analysis of
  the fMRI data. By means of the proposed EEG-predictor we observe core nodes of known
  fMRI resting state networks with high specificity in the default mode, the executive
  control and the salience network. Our results suggest that both, the stationary
  EEG pattern as well as resting state fMRI networks are different expressions of
  the same brain activity. This activity is interpreted as the dynamics on (or close
  to) a stable attractor in phase space that is necessary to maintain the brain in
  an efficient operational mode. We discuss that this interpretation is congruent
  with the theoretical framework of complex systems as well as with the brain's energy
  balance.
