abstract: Fibromyalgia, a condition characterized by chronic pain, is frequently accompanied
  by emotional disturbances. Here we aimed to study brain activation and functional
  connectivity (FC) during processing of emotional stimuli in fibromyalgia. Thirty
  female patients with fibromyalgia and 31 female healthy controls (HC) were included.
  Psychometric tests were administered to measure alexithymia, affective state, and
  severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Next, participants performed an emotion
  processing and regulation task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
  We performed a 2,×,2 ANCOVA to analyze main effects and interactions of the stimuli
  valence (positive or negative) and group (fibromyalgia or HC) on brain activation.
  Generalized psychophysiological interaction analysis was used to assess task-dependent
  FC of brain regions previously associated with emotion processing and fibromyalgia
  (i.e., hippocampus, amygdala, anterior insula, and pregenual anterior cingulate
  cortex [pACC]). The left superior lateral occipital cortex showed more activation
  in fibromyalgia during emotion processing than in HC, irrespective of valence. Moreover,
  we found an interaction effect (valence x group) in the FC between the left pACC
  and the precentral and postcentral cortex, and central operculum, and premotor cortex.
  These results suggest abnormal brain activation and connectivity underlying emotion
  processing in fibromyalgia, which could help explain the high prevalence of psychopathological
  symptoms in this condition.
