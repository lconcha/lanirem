abstract: Longitudinal non-human primate neuroimaging has the potential to greatly
  enhance our understanding of primate brain structure and function. Here we describe
  its specific strengths, compared to both cross-sectional non-human primate neuroimaging
  and longitudinal human neuroimaging, but also its associated challenges. We elaborate
  on factors guiding the use of different analytical tools, subject-specific versus
  age-specific templates for analyses, and issues related to statistical power.
