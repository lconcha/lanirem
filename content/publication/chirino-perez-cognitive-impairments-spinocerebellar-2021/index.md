abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 is a neurodegenerative disorder
  caused by the expansion of an ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat. Its clinical features
  include ataxia and, in some cases, epileptic seizures. There is, however, a dearth
  of information about its cognitive deficits and the neural bases underpinning them.
  OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to characterize the performance of
  spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 patients in 2 cognitive domains typically affected
  in spinocerebellar ataxias, memory and executive function, and to correlate the
  identified cognitive impairments with ataxia severity and cerebral/cerebellar cortical
  thickness, as quantified by MRI. METHODS: Memory and executive function tests were
  administered to 17 genetically confirmed Mexican spinocerebellar ataxia type 10
  patients, and their results were compared with 17 healthy matched volunteers. MRI
  was performed in 16 patients. RESULTS: Patients showed deficits in visual and visuospatial
  short-term memory, reduced storage capacity for verbal memory, and impaired monitoring,
  planning, and cognitive flexibility, which were ataxia independent. Patients with
  seizures (n~=~9) and without seizures (n~=~8) did not differ significantly in cognitive
  performance. There were significant correlations between short-term visuospatial
  memory impairment and posterior cerebellar lobe cortical thickness (bilateral lobule
  VI, IX, and right X). Cognitive flexibility deficiencies correlated with cerebral
  cortical thickness in the left middle frontal, cingulate, opercular, and temporal
  gyri. Cerebellar cortical thickness in several bilateral regions was correlated
  with motor impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 10
  show significant memory and executive dysfunction that can be correlated with deterioration
  in the posterior lobe of the cerebellum and prefrontal, cingulate, and middle temporal
  cortices.'
