 abstractnote = {Myotonic Dystrophy Type I (DM1) is a neurodegenerative, genetic, and multisystemic disorder with a large variety of symptoms due to a CTG trinucleotide expansion located on Dystrophia Myotonica Protein Kinase (DMPK) gene. Previous reports have shown cognitive deterioration in these patients. Given that white matter (WM) degradation has also been reported in DM1 patients, here we explored if alterations in the cognitive profile of DM1 patients could be related to the deterioration of WM.},
