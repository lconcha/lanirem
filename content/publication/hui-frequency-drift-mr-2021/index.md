abstract: "PURPOSE: Heating of gradient coils and passive shim components is a common\
  \ cause of instability in the B0 field, especially when gradient intensive sequences\
  \ are used. The aim of the study was to set a benchmark for typical drift encountered\
  \ during MR spectroscopy (MRS) to assess the need for real-time field-frequency\
  \ locking on MRI scanners by comparing field drift data from a large number of sites.\
  \ METHOD: A standardized protocol was developed for 80 participating sites using\
  \ 99 3T MR scanners from 3 major vendors. Phantom water signals were acquired before\
  \ and after an EPI sequence. The protocol consisted of: minimal preparatory imaging;\
  \ a short pre-fMRI PRESS; a ten-minute fMRI acquisition; and a long post-fMRI PRESS\
  \ acquisition. Both pre- and post-fMRI PRESS were non-water suppressed. Real-time\
  \ frequency stabilization/adjustment was switched off when appropriate. Sixty scanners\
  \ repeated the protocol for a second dataset. In addition, a three-hour post-fMRI\
  \ MRS acquisition was performed at one site to observe change of gradient temperature\
  \ and drift rate. Spectral analysis was performed using MATLAB. Frequency drift\
  \ in pre-fMRI PRESS data were compared with the first 5:20 minutes and the full\
  \ 30:00 minutes of data after fMRI. Median (interquartile range) drifts were measured\
  \ and showed in violin plot. Paired t-tests were performed to compare frequency\
  \ drift pre- and post-fMRI. A simulated in vivo spectrum was generated using FID-A\
  \ to visualize the effect of the observed frequency drifts. The simulated spectrum\
  \ was convolved with the frequency trace for the most extreme cases. Impacts of\
  \ frequency drifts on NAA and GABA were also simulated as a function of linear drift.\
  \ Data from the repeated protocol were compared with the corresponding first dataset\
  \ using Pearson's and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). RESULTS: Of the\
  \ data collected from 99 scanners, 4 were excluded due to various reasons. Thus,\
  \ data from 95 scanners were ultimately analyzed. For the first 5:20 min (64 transients),\
  \ median (interquartile range) drift was 0.44 (1.29) Hz before fMRI and 0.83 (1.29)\
  \ Hz after. This increased to 3.15 (4.02) Hz for the full 30 min (360 transients)\
  \ run. Average drift rates were 0.29 Hz/min before fMRI and 0.43 Hz/min after. Paired\
  \ t-tests indicated that drift increased after fMRI, as expected (p $<$ 0.05). Simulated\
  \ spectra convolved with the frequency drift showed that the intensity of the NAA\
  \ singlet was reduced by up to 26%, 44 % and 18% for GE, Philips and Siemens scanners\
  \ after fMRI, respectively. ICCs indicated good agreement between datasets acquired\
  \ on separate days. The single site long acquisition showed drift rate was reduced\
  \ to 0.03 Hz/min approximately three hours after fMRI. DISCUSSION: This study analyzed\
  \ frequency drift data from 95 3T MRI scanners. Median levels of drift were relatively\
  \ low (5-min average under 1 Hz), but the most extreme cases suffered from higher\
  \ levels of drift. The extent of drift varied across scanners which both linear\
  \ and nonlinear drifts were observed."
