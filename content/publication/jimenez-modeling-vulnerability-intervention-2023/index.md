abstract: 'Modeling psychopathology as a complex dynamic system represents Borderline
  Personality Disorder (BPD) as a constellation of symptoms (e.g., nodes) that feedback
  and self-sustain each other shaping a network structure. Through in silico interventions,
  we simulated the evolution of the BPD system by manipulating: 1) the connectivity
  strength between nodes (i.e., vulnerability), 2) the external disturbances (i.e.,
  stress) and 3) the predisposition of symptoms to manifest. Similarly, using network
  analysis we evaluated the effect of an in vivo group psychotherapy to detect the
  symptoms modified by the intervention. We found that a network with greater connectivity
  strength between nodes (more vulnerable) showed a higher number of activated symptoms
  than networks with less strength connectivity. We also found that increases in stress
  affected more vulnerable networks compared to less vulnerable ones, while decreases
  in stress revealed a hysteresis effect in the most strongly connected networks.
  The in silico intervention to symptom alleviation revealed the relevance of nodes
  related to difficulty in anger regulation, nodes which were also detected as impacted
  by the in vivo intervention. The complex systems methodology is an alternative to
  the common cause model with which research has approached the BPD phenomenon.'
