abstract: The interest in studying the neural circuits related to mating behavior
  and mate choice in monogamous species lies in the parallels found between human
  social structure and sexual behavior and that of other mammals that exhibit social
  monogamy, potentially expanding our understanding of human neurobiology and its
  underlying mechanisms. Extensive research has suggested that social monogamy, as
  opposed to non-monogamy in mammals, is a consequence of the neural encoding of sociosensory
  information from the sexual partner with an increased reward value. Thus, the reinforced
  value of the mate outweighs the reward value of mating with any other potential
  sexual partners. This mechanism reinforces the social relationship of a breeding
  pair, commonly defined as a pair bond. In addition to accentuated prosocial behaviors
  toward the partner, other characteristic behaviors may appear, such as territorial
  and partner guarding, selective aggression toward unfamiliar conspecifics, and biparental
  care. Concomitantly, social buffering and distress upon partner separation are also
  observed. The following work intends to overview and compare known neural and functional
  circuits that are related to mating and sexual behavior in monogamous mammals. We
  will particularly discuss reports on Cricetid rodents of the Microtus and Peromyscus
  genus, and New World primates (NWP), such as the Callicebinae subfamily of the titi
  monkey and the marmoset (Callithrix spp.). In addition, we will mention the main
  factors that modulate the neural circuits related to social monogamy and how that
  modulation may reflect phenotypic differences, ultimately creating the widely observed
  diversity in social behavior.
