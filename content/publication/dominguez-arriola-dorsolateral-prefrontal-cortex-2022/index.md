abstract: Empathic abilities have been shown to be linked with brain structural variations.
  Since psychotherapists constitute a population that tends to display greater empathic
  abilities, as shown in psychometric differences in cognitive empathy and emotional
  regulation, we aimed to identify cortical thickness (CT) differences between a group
  of professional psychotherapists and a control group. In line with the recently
  emphasized urge to employ more than a single workflow in cortical analyses, we utilized
  two cortical surface extraction and thickness estimation pipelines—CIVET and FreeSurfer.
  Eighteen psychotherapists and eighteen controls underwent MRI scanning and completed
  empathy-related psychometric assessments. We evaluated how CT measures differed
  between groups and if there was an association with individual empathy-related scores
  in a series of regions of interest (ROIs). Our analysis with CIVET shows that psychotherapists
  display a significantly greater CT at a ROI in the left dorsolateral prefrontal
  cortex (dlPFC; p,$<$,0.05, FDR corrected). With FreeSurfer, a whole-brain vertex-wise
  analysis identified a statistically significant cluster in the left PFC that partially
  overlaps with the previous ROI. These results were reinforced by a structural covariance
  analysis revealing that, in psychotherapists, the left dlPFC ROI seemed to vary
  independently from the rest of the cortex. These findings are relevant because the
  dlPFC region importantly participates in the cognitive components of the empathic
  response, such as emotion regulation and perspective taking. Thus, our findings
  support the idea that empathic capacity is reflected by brain structural variations
  while also studying for the first time a sample of subjects for whom empathic responding
  is crucial in their profession.
