 abstract = {Empathic abilities have been shown to be linked with brain structural variations. Since psychotherapists constitute a population that tends to display greater empathic abilities, as shown in psychometric differences in cognitive empathy and emotional regulation, we aimed to identify cortical thickness (CT) differences between a group of professional psychotherapists and a control group. In line with the recently emphasized urge to employ more than a single workflow in cortical analyses, we utilized two cortical surface extraction and thickness estimation pipelines—CIVET and FreeSurfer. Eighteen psychotherapists and eighteen controls underwent MRI scanning and completed empathy-related psychometric assessments. We evaluated how CT measures differed between groups and if there was an association with individual empathy-related scores in a series of regions of interest (ROIs). Our analysis with CIVET shows that psychotherapists display a significantly greater CT at a ROI in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; p\,$<$\,0.05, FDR corrected). With FreeSurfer, a whole-brain vertex-wise analysis identified a statistically significant cluster in the left PFC that partially overlaps with the previous ROI. These results were reinforced by a structural covariance analysis revealing that, in psychotherapists, the left dlPFC ROI seemed to vary independently from the rest of the cortex. These findings are relevant because the dlPFC region importantly participates in the cognitive components of the empathic response, such as emotion regulation and perspective taking. Thus, our findings support the idea that empathic capacity is reflected by brain structural variations while also studying for the first time a sample of subjects for whom empathic responding is crucial in their profession.},
