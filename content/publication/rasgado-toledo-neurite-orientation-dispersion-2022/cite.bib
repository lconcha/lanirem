 abstract = {Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by a compulsive search for cocaine. Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit cognitive deficits, including lack of inhibition and decision-making as well as brain volume and diffusion-based white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female) retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN), using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) analysis, which aims to more accurately model microstructural pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were also correlated with clinical measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. We found higher whole-brain microstructural pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum, forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal GM structures. We also found correlations between significant ROI and impulsivity, onset age of cocaine use and weekly dosage with Viso-NODDI. However, we did not find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, although their clinical relevance remains questionable, microstructural pathology seems to be present in CUD both in gray and white matter.},
