abstract: Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by a compulsive search for cocaine.
  Several studies have shown that cocaine users exhibit cognitive deficits, including
  lack of inhibition and decision-making as well as brain volume and diffusion-based
  white-matter alterations in a wide variety of brain regions. However, the non-specificity
  of standard volumetric and diffusion-tensor methods to detect structural micropathology
  may lead to wrong conclusions. To better understand microstructural pathology in
  CUD, we analyzed 60 CUD participants (3 female) and 43 non-CUD controls (HC; 2 female)
  retrospectively from our cross-sectional Mexican SUD neuroimaging dataset (SUDMEX-CONN),
  using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the neurite orientation dispersion
  and density imaging (NODDI) analysis, which aims to more accurately model microstructural
  pathology. We used Viso values of NODDI that employ a three-compartment model in
  white (WM) and gray-matter (GM). These values were also correlated with clinical
  measures, including psychiatric severity status, impulsive behavior and pattern
  of cocaine and tobacco use in the CUD group. We found higher whole-brain microstructural
  pathology in WM and GM in CUD patients than controls. ROI analysis revealed higher
  Viso-NODDI values in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, hippocampus cingulum,
  forceps minor and Uncinate fasciculus, as well as in frontal and parieto-temporal
  GM structures. We also found correlations between significant ROI and impulsivity,
  onset age of cocaine use and weekly dosage with Viso-NODDI. However, we did not
  find correlations with psychopathology measures. Overall, although their clinical
  relevance remains questionable, microstructural pathology seems to be present in
  CUD both in gray and white matter.
