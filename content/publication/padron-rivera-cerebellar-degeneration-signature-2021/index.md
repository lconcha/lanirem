abstract: Recent findings suggest a significant effect of the cerebellar circuit deterioration
  on the clinical manifestation of Huntington's disease, calling for a better understanding
  of the cerebellar degeneration in this disorder. Recent brain imaging analyses have
  provided conflicting results regarding the cerebellar changes during the progression
  of this disease. To help in resolving this controversy, we examined the cerebellar
  gray matter structural integrity from a cohort of HD patients. Whole brain voxel-based
  morphometry (VBM) and spatially unbiased atlas template of the human cerebellum
  (SUIT) analyses were done from T1-weighted brain images. Our results showed a significant
  cerebellar degeneration without any sign of volume increase. The highest cerebellar
  degeneration was identified in Crus I right lobule, Crus II bilaterally, and left
  VIIb, and left VIIIa lobules. The cerebellar degeneration signature, which controls
  for severity of degeneration, showed a degeneration pattern that included regions
  Iâ€“ IV, Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb and X.
