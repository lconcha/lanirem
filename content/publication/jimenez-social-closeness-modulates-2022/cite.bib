 abstract = {Anticipation of trust from someone with high social closeness is expected. However, if there is uncertainty in the interaction because a person is a stranger or because he has distrusted us on another occasion, we need to keep track of his behavior and intentions. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) we wanted to find the brain regions related to trust anticipation from partners who differ in their level of social closeness. We designed an experiment in which 30 participants played an adapted trust game with three trustors: A computer, a stranger, and a real friend. We covertly manipulated their decisions in the game, so they trusted 75% of the trials and distrusted in remaining trials. Using a psychophysiological interaction analysis, we found increases in functional coupling between the anterior insula (AIns) and intra parietal sulcus (IPS) during trust anticipation between a high versus low social closeness partner. Also, the right parietal cortex was coupled with the fusiform gyrus (FG) and the inferior/middle temporal gyrus during trust anticipation of a friend versus a stranger. These results suggest that brain regions involved in encoding the intentions of others are recruited during trust anticipation from a friend compared to a stranger.},
