abstract: 'Anticipation of trust from someone with high social closeness is expected.
  However, if there is uncertainty in the interaction because a person is a stranger
  or because he has distrusted us on another occasion, we need to keep track of his
  behavior and intentions. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) we wanted
  to find the brain regions related to trust anticipation from partners who differ
  in their level of social closeness. We designed an experiment in which 30 participants
  played an adapted trust game with three trustors: A computer, a stranger, and a
  real friend. We covertly manipulated their decisions in the game, so they trusted
  75% of the trials and distrusted in remaining trials. Using a psychophysiological
  interaction analysis, we found increases in functional coupling between the anterior
  insula (AIns) and intra parietal sulcus (IPS) during trust anticipation between
  a high versus low social closeness partner. Also, the right parietal cortex was
  coupled with the fusiform gyrus (FG) and the inferior/middle temporal gyrus during
  trust anticipation of a friend versus a stranger. These results suggest that brain
  regions involved in encoding the intentions of others are recruited during trust
  anticipation from a friend compared to a stranger.'
