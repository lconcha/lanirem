abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a disease characterized by reduced social
  interaction and stereotypic behaviors and related to macroscopic volumetric changes
  in cerebellar and somatosensory cortices (SPP). Epidemiological and preclinical
  models have confirmed that a proinflammatory profile during fetal development increases
  ASD susceptibility after birth. Here, we aimed to globally identify the effect of
  maternal exposure to high-energy dense diets, which we refer to as cafeteria diet
  (CAF) on peripheral and central proinflammatory profiles, microglia reactivity,
  and volumetric brain changes related to assisting defective social interaction in
  the mice offspring. We found a sex-dependent effect of maternal exposure to CAF
  diet or inoculation of the dsARN mimetic Poly (I:C) on peripheral proinflammatory
  and social interaction in the offspring. Notably, maternal exposure to CAF diet
  impairs social interaction and favors an increase in anxiety in male but not female
  offspring. Also, CAF diet exposure or Poly (I:C) inoculation during fetal programming
  promote peripheral proinflammatory profile in the ASD-diagnosed male but not in
  females. Selectively, we found a robust accumulation of the monocyte chemoattractant
  protein-1 (MCP-1) in plasma of ASD-diagnosed males exposed to CAF during fetal development.
  Biological assessment of MCP-1 signaling in brain confirms that systemic injection
  of MCP-1-neutralizing antibody reestablished social interaction and blocked anxiety,
  accompanied by a reduction in cerebellar lobule X (CbX) volume and an increase volume
  of the primary somatosensory (SSP) cortex in male offspring. These data highlight
  the contribution of diet-dependent MCP-1 signaling on volumetric brain changes and
  microglia morphology promoting ASD-like behavior in male mice.
