abstract: 'BACKGROUND: In healthy older adults, excess theta activity is an electroencephalographic
  (EEG) predictor of cognitive impairment. In a previous study, neurofeedback (NFB)
  treatment reinforcing reductions theta activity resulted in EEG reorganization and
  cognitive improvement. OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical applicability of this
  NFB treatment, the present study performed a 1-year follow-up to determine its lasting
  effects. METHODS: Twenty seniors with excessive theta activity in their EEG were
  randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. The experimental group received
  an auditory reward when the theta absolute power (AP) was reduced. The control group
  received the reward randomly. RESULTS: Both groups showed a significant decrease
  in theta activity at the training electrode. However, the EEG results showed that
  only the experimental group underwent global changes after treatment. These changes
  consisted of delta and theta decreases and beta increases. Although no changes were
  found in any group during the period between the posttreatment evaluation and follow-up,
  more pronounced theta decreases and beta increases were observed in the experimental
  group when the follow-up and pretreatment measures were compared. Executive functions
  showed a tendency to improve two months after treatment which became significant
  one year later. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the EEG and behavioral benefits
  of this NFB treatment persist for at least one year, which adds up to the available
  evidence contributing to identifying factors that increase its efficacy level. The
  relevance of this study lies in its prophylactic features of addressing a clinically
  healthy population with EEG risk of cognitive decline.'
