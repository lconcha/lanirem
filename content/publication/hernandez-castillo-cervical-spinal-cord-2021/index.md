abstract: "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 is an autosomal dominant\
  \ neurodegenerative disease caused by a cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansion.\
  \ Clinically, spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 is characterized by progressive cerebellar\
  \ ataxia, pyramidal signs, and macular degeneration. In vivo MR imaging studies\
  \ have shown extensive gray matter degeneration in the cerebellum and, to a lesser\
  \ extent, in a range of cortical cerebral areas. The purpose of this study was to\
  \ evaluate the impact of the disease in the spinal cord and its relationship with\
  \ the patient's impairment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a semiautomated procedure\
  \ applied to MR imaging data, we analyzed spinal cord area and eccentricity in a\
  \ cohort of 48 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 and compared them with\
  \ matched healthy controls. The motor impairment in the patient group was evaluated\
  \ using the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia. RESULTS: Our analysis showed\
  \ a significantly smaller cord area (t = 9.04, P $<$ .001, d = 1.31) and greater\
  \ eccentricity (t,=,-2.25, P =. 02, d = 0.32) in the patient group. Similarly, smaller\
  \ cord area was significantly correlated with a greater Scale for Assessment and\
  \ Rating of Ataxia score (r = -0.44, P,=,.001). A multiple regression model showed\
  \ that the spinal cord area was strongly associated with longer CAG repetition expansions\
  \ (P,=,.002) and greater disease duration (P,=,.020). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings\
  \ indicate that cervical spinal cord changes are progressive and clinically relevant\
  \ features of spinocerebellar ataxia type 7, and future investigation of these measures\
  \ as candidate biomarkers is warranted."
