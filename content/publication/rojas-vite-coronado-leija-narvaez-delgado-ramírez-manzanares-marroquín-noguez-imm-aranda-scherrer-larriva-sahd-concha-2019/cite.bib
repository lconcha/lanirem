tex.abstractnote: Micro-architectural characteristics of white matter can be inferred through analysis of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). The diffusion-dependent signal can be analyzed through several methods, with the tensor model being the most frequently used due to its straightforward interpretation and low requirements for acquisition parameters. While valuable information can be gained from the tensor-derived metrics in regions of homogeneous tissue organization, this model does not provide reliable microstructural information at crossing fiber regions, which are pervasive throughout human white matter. Several multiple fiber models have been proposed that seem to overcome the limitations of the tensor, with few providing per-bundle dMRI-derived metrics. However, biological interpretations of such metrics are limited by the lack of histological confirmation. To this end, we developed a straightforward biological validation framework. Unilateral retinal ischemia was induced in ten rats, which resulted in axonal (Wallerian) degeneration of the corresponding optic nerve, while the contralateral was left intact; the intact and injured axonal populations meet at the optic chiasm as they cross the midline, generating a fiber crossing region in which each population has different diffusion properties. Five rats served as controls. High-resolution ex vivo dMRI was acquired five weeks after experimental procedures. We correlated and compared histology to per-bundle descriptors derived from three methodologies for dMRI analysis (constrained spherical deconvolution and two multi-tensor representations). We found a tight correlation between axonal density (as evaluated through automatic segmentation of histological sections) with per-bundle apparent fiber density and fractional anisotropy (derived from dMRI). The multi-fiber methods explored were able to correctly identify the damaged fiber populations in a region of fiber crossings (chiasm). Our results provide validation of metrics that bring substantial and clinically useful information about white-matter tissue at crossing fiber regions. Our proposed framework is useful to validate other current and future dMRI methods.
