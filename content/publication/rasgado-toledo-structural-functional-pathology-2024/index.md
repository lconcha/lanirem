abstract: Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is described as a compulsive urge to seek and
  consume cocaine despite the inimical consequences. MRI studies from different modalities
  have shown that CUD patients exhibit structural and/or functional connectivity pathology
  among several brain regions. Nevertheless, both connectivities are commonly studied
  and analyzed separately, which may potentially obscure its relationship between
  them, and with the clinical pathology. Here, we compare structural and functional
  brain networks in CUD patients and healthy controls (HC) using multimodal fusion.
  The sample consisted of 63 (8 females) CUD patients and 42 (9 females) healthy controls
  (HC), recruited as part of the SUDMEX CONN database. For this, we computed a battery
  of graph-based measures from multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and resting
  state fc-fMRI to quantify local and global connectivity. Then we used multimodal
  canonical component analysis plus joint independent component analysis (mCCA+jICA)
  to compare between techniques and evaluate group differences and its association
  with clinical alteration. Unimodal results showed a striatal decrease in the participation
  coefficient but applied supervised data fusion revealed other regions with cocaine-related
  alterations in joint functional communication. When performing multimodal fusion
  analysis, we observed a higher centrality of the interrelationship and a lower participation
  coefficient in patients with CUD. In contrast to the unimodal approach, the multimodal
  fusion method was able to reveal latent information about brain regions involved
  in impairment due to cocaine abuse. The present results could help in understanding
  the pathology of CUD to develop better pre-treatment/post-treatment intervention
  designs.
