 abstractnote = {This study explored the effect of an early attention-stimulation program (EASP) on preterm infants with cerebral white matter injury and attention delay (AD). Monthly behavioral measures (from 3 to 8 months of age) and EEG recordings using a 2-tone oddball paradigm were collected at the beginning and at the end of the treatment. Ten full-term and 21 preterm infants with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) and AD were examined. Eleven preterm infants were randomly assigned to the EASP (treatment preterm group) and 10 to a nontreatment preterm group. The behavioral results showed a significant improvement of attention in the treatment preterm group at 7 months of age. The electrophysiological data showed that deviant tones elicited greater P3a than standard tones in all 3 groups at 3 months of age; while at 8 months, only the healthy group showed this positive peak. In the treatment preterm group, deviant tones elicited a greater Nc than standard tones. In the nontreatment preterm group, the deviant tones did not elicit greater P3a or Nc than the standard tones at 8 months of age. These results demonstrate that when preterm infants with brain damage were treated with EASP, electrophysiological markers associated with the involuntarily capture of attention were observed, but these markers differed from those in healthy infants. Therefore, we propose that treatment with EASP may decrease the attention deficits associated with PVL in preterm infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},
