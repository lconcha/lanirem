abstract: Introduction Early Huntington's disease (HD) patients begin to show planning
  deficits even before motor alterations start to manifest. Generally, planning ability
  is associated with the functioning of anterior brain areas such as the medial prefrontal
  cortex. However, early HD neuropathology involves significant atrophy in the occipital
  and parietal cortex, suggesting that more posterior regions could also be involved
  in these planning deficits. Objective To identify brain regions associated with
  planning deficits in HD patients at an early clinical stage. Materials and methods
  Twenty-two HD-subjects genetically confirmed with incipient clinical manifestation
  and twenty healthy subjects were recruited. All participants underwent MRI T1 image
  acquisition as well as testing in the Stockings of Cambridge (SOC) task to measure
  planning ability. First, group comparison of SOC measures were performed. Then,
  correlation voxel-based morphometry analyses were done between gray matter degeneration
  and SOC performance in the HD group. Results Accuracy and efficiency planning scores
  correlated with gray matter density in right lingual gyrus, middle temporal gyrus,
  anterior cingulate gyrus, and paracingulate gyrus. Conclusions Our results suggest
  that planning deficits exhibited by early HD-subjects are related to occipital and
  temporal cortical degeneration in addition to the frontal areas deterioration.
