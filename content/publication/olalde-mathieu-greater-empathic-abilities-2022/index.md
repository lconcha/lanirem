abstract: In a therapeutic environment a proper regulation of the empathic response
  strengthens the patient-therapist relationship. Thus, it is important that psychotherapists
  constantly regulate their own perspective and emotions to better understand the
  other's affective state. We compared the empathic abilities of a group of 52 psychotherapists
  with a group of 92 non-psychotherapists and found psychometric differences. Psychotherapists
  showed greater scores in Fantasy and Perspective Taking, both cognitive empathy
  constructs, and lower scores in the use of expressive suppression, an emotional
  regulation strategy that hampers the empathic response, suggesting that psychotherapists
  exert top-down processes that influence their empathic response. In addition, the
  expected sex differences in empathic concern and expressive suppression were only
  present in the non-psychotherapist group. To see if such psychometric differences
  were related to a distinctive functional organization of brain networks, we contrasted
  the resting state functional connectivity of empathy-related brain regions between
  a group of 18 experienced psychotherapists and a group of 18 non-psychotherapists.
  Psychotherapists showed greater functional connectivity between the left anterior
  insula and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and less connectivity between rostral
  anterior cingulate cortex and the orbito prefrontal cortex. Both associations correlated
  with Perspective Taking scores. Considering that the psychometric differences between
  groups were in the cognitive domain and that the functional connectivity associations
  involve areas related to cognitive regulation processes, these results suggest a
  relationship between the functional brain organization of psychotherapists and the
  cognitive regulation of their empathic response.
