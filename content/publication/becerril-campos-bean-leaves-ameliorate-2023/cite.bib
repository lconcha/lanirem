 abstract = {Bioactive compounds in plant-based food have protective effects against metabolic alterations, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Bean leaves are widely cultivated in the world and are a source of dietary fiber and polyphenols. High fat/high fructose diet animal models promote deleterious effects in adipose and non-adipose tissues (lipotoxicity), leading to obesity and its comorbidities. Short-term supplementation of bean leaves exhibited anti-diabetic, anti-hyperlipidemic, and anti-obesity effects in high-fat/high-fructose diet animal models. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of bean leaves supplementation in the prevention of lipotoxicity in NAFLD and contribute to elucidating the possible mechanism involved for a longer period of time. During thirteen weeks, male Wistar rats (n = 9/group) were fed with: (1) S: Rodent Laboratory Chow 5001® (RLC); (2) SBL: 90% RLC+ 10% dry bean leaves; (3) H: high-fat/high-fructose diet; (4) HBL: H+ 10% of dry bean leaves. Overall, a HBL diet enhanced impaired glucose tolerance and ameliorated obesity, risk factors in NAFLD development. Additionally, bean leaves exerted antioxidant ($p̆arrow$serum GSH) and anti-inflammatory ($↓$mRNA TNF$α$ in the liver) effects, prevented hepatic fat accumulation by enhanced $\ărrow$mRNA PPAR$α$ ($β$ oxidation), and enhanced lipid peroxidation ($↓$liver MDA). These findings suggest that bean leaves ameliorated hepatic lipotoxicity derived from the consumption of a deleterious diet.},
