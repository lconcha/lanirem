abstract: The brain is one of the most sensitive organs damaged during aging due to
  its susceptibility to the aging-related oxidative stress. Hence, in this study,
  the sensory nerve pathway integrity and the memory were evaluated and related to
  the redox state, the antioxidant enzymes function, and the protein oxidative damage
  in the brain cortex (Cx) and the hippocampus (Hc) of young (4-month-old) and old
  (24-month-old) male and female Wistar rats. Evoked potentials (EP) were performed
  for the auditory, visual, and somatosensory pathways. In both males and females,
  the old rat groups' latencies were larger in almost all waves when compared to the
  young same-sex animals. The novel object test was performed to evaluate memory.
  The superoxide dismutase and catalase antioxidant activity, as well as the protein
  oxidative damage, and the redox state were evaluated. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging
  was used to obtain the diffusion tensor imaging, and the brain volume, while MR
  spectroscopy was used to obtain the brain metabolite concentrations (glutamine,
  glutamate, Myo-inositol, N-acetyl-aspartate, creatine) in the Cx and the Hc of young
  and old females. Our data suggest that, although there are limited variations regarding
  memory and nerve conduction velocity by sex, the differences concerning the redox
  status might be important to explain the dissimilar reactions during brain aging
  between males and females. Moreover, the increment in Myo-inositol levels in the
  Hc of old rats and the brain volume decrease suggest that redox state alterations
  might be correlated to neuroinflammation during brain aging.
