abstract: Prenatal exposure to high-energy diets primes brain alterations that increase
  the risk of developing behavioral and cognitive failures. Alterations in the structure
  and connectivity of brain involved in learning and memory performance are found
  in adult obese murine models and in humans. However, the role of prenatal exposure
  to high-energy diets in the modulation of the brain's structure and function during
  cognitive decline remains unknown. We used female C57BL6 mice (n~=~10) exposed to
  a high-energy diets (Cafeteria diet (CAF)) or Chow diet for 9~weeks (before, during
  and after pregnancy) to characterize their effect on brain structural organization
  and learning and memory performance in the offspring at two-month-old (n~=~17).
  Memory and learning performance were evaluated using the Y-maze test including forced
  and spontaneous alternation, novel object recognition (NORT), open field and Barnes
  maze tests. We found no alterations in the short- or long-time spatial memory performance
  in male offspring prenatally exposed to CAF diet when compared to the control, but
  they increased time spent in the edges resembling anxiety-like behavior. By using
  deformation-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging analysis we found that
  male offspring exposed to CAF diet showed increased volume in primary somatosensory
  cortex and a reduced volume of fimbria-fornix, which correlate with alterations
  in its white matter integrity. Biological modeling revealed that prenatal exposure
  to CAF diet predicts low volume in the fimbria-fornix, which was associated with
  anxiety in the offspring. The findings suggest that prenatal exposure to high-energy
  diets prime brain structural alterations related to anxiety in the offspring.
