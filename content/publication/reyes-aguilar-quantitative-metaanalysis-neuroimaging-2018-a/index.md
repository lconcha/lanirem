abstract: Pragmatics may be defined as the ability to communicate by expressing and
  recognizing intentions. The objective of this meta-analysis was to identify neural
  substrates for comprehension of pragmatic content in general, as well as the differences
  between pragmatic forms, and to describe if there is differential recruitment of
  brain areas according to natural language. This meta-analysis included 48 functional
  magnetic resonance imaging studies that reported pragmatic versus literal language
  contrasts. The pragmatic forms were speech acts, metaphors, idioms, and irony. Effect
  Size-Signed Differential Mapping software was used to calculate the mean for all
  contrasts as well as for each pragmatic form, and make comparisons among all forms.
  Due to variations in pragmatic content configuration such as natural language, stimulus
  modality, and writing systems, these variations were also analyzed with subgroups'
  analyses. The analyses found a highly reproducible bilateral fronto-temporal and
  medial prefrontal cortex network for pragmatic comprehension. Each pragmatic form
  showed a specific convergence pattern within this bilateral network. Natural language
  analyses showed that fronto-temporal regions were recruited by Germanic languages,
  while only left frontal areas were recruited by Romance languages, and right medial
  prefrontal cortex by Japanese. In conclusion, pragmatic language comprehension involves
  classical language areas in bilateral perisylvian regions, along with the medial
  prefrontal cortex, an area involved in social cognition. Together, these areas could
  represent the \"pragmatic language network\". Nonetheless, when proposing a universal
  neural substrate for all forms of pragmatic language, the diversity among studies
  in terms of pragmatic form, and configuration, must be taken into consideration.
