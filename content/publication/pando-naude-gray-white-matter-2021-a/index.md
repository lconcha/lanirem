abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) are characterized by a compulsion to seek
  and consume one or more substances of abuse, with a perceived loss of control and
  a negative emotional state. Prolonged substance use seems to be associated with
  morphological changes of multiple neural circuits, in particular the frontalâ€“ striatal
  and limbic pathways. Such neuroadaptations are evident across several substance
  disorders, but may vary depending on the type of substance, consumption severity
  and/or other unknown factors. We therefore identified studies investigating the
  effects of SUDs using volumetric whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in gray
  (GM) and white matter (WM). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of
  VBM studies using the anatomic likelihood estimation (ALE) method implemented in
  GingerALE (PROSPERO pre-registration CRD42017071222). Sixty studies met inclusion
  criteria and were included in the final quantitative meta-analysis, with a total
  of 614 foci, 94 experiments and 4938 participants. We found convergence and divergence
  in brain regions and volume effects (higher vs. lower volume) in GM and WM depending
  on the severity of the consumption pattern and type of substance used. Convergent
  pathology was evident across substances in GM of the insula, anterior cingulate
  cortex, putamen, and thalamus, and in WM of the thalamic radiation and internal
  capsule bundle. Divergent pathology between occasional use (cortical pathology)
  and addiction (cortical-subcortical pathology) provides evidence of a possible top-down
  neuroadaptation. Our findings indicate particular brain morphometry alterations
  in SUDs, which may inform our understanding of disease progression and ultimately
  therapeutic approaches.
