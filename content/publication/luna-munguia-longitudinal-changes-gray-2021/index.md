abstract: '$<$h2$>$Abstract$<$/h2$><$h3$>$Purpose$<$/h3$><$p$>$Temporal lobe epilepsy
  is associated with tissue abnormalities of several gray and white matter structures
  that are reproduced in animal models. Few longitudinal studies have focused on the
  identification of structural differences during epileptogenesis. The diffusion tensor
  model is a useful tool for evaluating cell death, gliosis, and axonal plasticity
  in epileptic subjects. This study aimed to evaluate temporal tissue changes after
  experimental emphstatus epilepticus in an animal model of chronic temporal lobe
  epilepsy.$<$/p$><$h3$>$Methods$<$/h3$><$p$>$Systemic pilocarpine-induced emphstatus
  epilepticus in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were scanned using diffusion tensor
  imaging (DTI) at three time points: prior to emphstatus epilepticus, and 24 and
  64 days post-induction (early and late chronic, respectively). Fractional anisotropy,
  apparent diffusion coefficient, axial diffusivity (Dtextsubscript|), and radial
  diffusivity (Dtextsubscript+) were evaluated in white (fimbria, cingulum, corpus
  callosum, and internal capsule) and gray (dorsal hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and
  CA3) matter regions for the three time points. Histological assessment of neurodegeneration
  in Kl√ºver-Barrera preparations from the same animals was performed.$<$/p$><$h3$>$Results$<$/h3$><$p$>$Significantly
  reduced volume of dorsal hippocampus and fimbria of the epileptic animals was observed
  already at 24 days post-emphstatus epilepticus. Progressive changes of DTI parameters
  in both the white and gray matter structures of the experimental group were also
  observed. Stained sections confirmed such alterations.$<$/p$><$h3$>$Conclusion$<$/h3$><$p$>$Our
  study revealed time-dependent diffusion changes in gray and white matter structures
  after pilocarpine-induced emphstatus epilepticus. The characterization of these
  alterations over time may be potential imaging markers for epileptogenesis.$<$/p$>$'
