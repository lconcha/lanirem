abstract: Pragmatic competence demands linguistic, but also communicative, social
  and cognitive competence. Successful use of language in social interaction requires
  mutual understanding of the speaker's intentions; without it, a conversation cannot
  proceed. The term speech act refers to what a speaker intends to accomplish when
  saying something. The purpose of this study was to contribute to the identification
  of the neural substrate of speech act recognition and to the characterization of
  the cognitive processes that may be involved. The recognition of speech acts resulted
  in greater activation of frontal regions, precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus.
  From all cognitive and behavioral measures obtained, only the scores in mental flexibility
  predicted the change in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the precuneus.
  These results, support the idea that speech act recognition requires the inference
  of intention, executive functions, including memory and entails the activation of
  areas of social cognition that participate in several brain networks i.e., the Intention
  Processing, the Default Mode and Theory of Mind networks, and areas involved in
  planning and guiding behavior.
