abstract: Several neuroimaging studies have reported associations between brain white
  matter microstructure and chronotype. However, it is unclear whether those phenotypic
  relationships are causal or underlined by genetic factors. In the present study,
  we use genetic data to examine the genetic overlap and infer causal relationships
  between chronotype and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures. We identify 29 significant
  pairwise genetic correlations, of which 13 also show evidence for a causal association.
  Genetic correlations were identified between chronotype and brain-wide mean, axial
  and radial diffusivities. When exploring individual tracts, 10 genetic correlations
  were observed with mean diffusivity, 10 with axial diffusivity, 4 with radial diffusivity
  and 2 with mode of anisotropy. We found evidence for a possible causal association
  of eveningness with white matter microstructure measures in individual tracts including
  the posterior limb and the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule; the genu
  and splenium of the corpus callosum and the posterior, superior and anterior regions
  of the corona radiata. Our findings contribute to the understanding of how genes
  influence circadian preference and brain white matter and provide a new avenue for
  investigating the role of chronotype in health and disease.
