 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: During hypnosis, significant changes in the BOLD signal associated with the anterior default mode network (DMN) and prefrontal attentional systems have been reported as evidence of dissociation defined since Charcot. However, it remains uncertain whether these changes are mainly attributable to the hypnotic state per se or to the target suggestions used to verify subject's state during neuroimaging studies. The aim of the present study is to evidence the brain in hypnosis, contrasting the common resting state versus neutral hypnosis (hypnosis in the absence of target suggestions). METHODS: Twenty-four healthy right-handed volunteers (age 28.3 y.o., 12 females) rated moderate hypnotic responsiveness underwent resting state fMRI at 3.0 T in two sessions, once in neutral hypnosis and the other in the common resting state. Each subject's functional data were analyzed for low-frequency BOLD signal correlations seed-to-voxel for the whole brain in the first-level analysis, and seed-to-voxel in a second-level analysis to estimate group results using seeds for five resting state networks: the default mode (DMN), the central executive (CEN), the salience (SaN), the dorso-lateral attention (DAN), and the sensorimotor (SMN) networks. RESULTS: In general, all network maps of the hypnotic condition presented higher connectivity than those of the resting condition. However, only contrasts for the DAN, SaN, and SMN were statistically significant, including correlated out-of-the-network regions. CONCLUSION: Parietal and occipital regions displayed increased connectivity across networks, implying dissociation from the frontal cortices. This is the first fMRI intrinsic study of hypnosis without target suggestion.},
