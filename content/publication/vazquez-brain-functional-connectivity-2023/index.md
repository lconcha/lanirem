abstract: "OBJECTIVE: During hypnosis, significant changes in the BOLD signal associated\
  \ with the anterior default mode network (DMN) and prefrontal attentional systems\
  \ have been reported as evidence of dissociation defined since Charcot. However,\
  \ it remains uncertain whether these changes are mainly attributable to the hypnotic\
  \ state per se or to the target suggestions used to verify subject's state during\
  \ neuroimaging studies. The aim of the present study is to evidence the brain in\
  \ hypnosis, contrasting the common resting state versus neutral hypnosis (hypnosis\
  \ in the absence of target suggestions). METHODS: Twenty-four healthy right-handed\
  \ volunteers (age 28.3 y.o., 12 females) rated moderate hypnotic responsiveness\
  \ underwent resting state fMRI at 3.0 T in two sessions, once in neutral hypnosis\
  \ and the other in the common resting state. Each subject's functional data were\
  \ analyzed for low-frequency BOLD signal correlations seed-to-voxel for the whole\
  \ brain in the first-level analysis, and seed-to-voxel in a second-level analysis\
  \ to estimate group results using seeds for five resting state networks: the default\
  \ mode (DMN), the central executive (CEN), the salience (SaN), the dorso-lateral\
  \ attention (DAN), and the sensorimotor (SMN) networks. RESULTS: In general, all\
  \ network maps of the hypnotic condition presented higher connectivity than those\
  \ of the resting condition. However, only contrasts for the DAN, SaN, and SMN were\
  \ statistically significant, including correlated out-of-the-network regions. CONCLUSION:\
  \ Parietal and occipital regions displayed increased connectivity across networks,\
  \ implying dissociation from the frontal cortices. This is the first fMRI intrinsic\
  \ study of hypnosis without target suggestion."
