abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Age is the main risk factor for the development of neurocognitive\
  \ disorders, with Alzheimer's disease being the most common. Its physiopathological\
  \ features may develop decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. Quantitative\
  \ electroencephalography (qEEG) is a promising and cost-effective tool for the prediction\
  \ of cognitive decline in healthy older individuals that exhibit an excess of theta\
  \ activity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of brain\
  \ connectivity variable resolution electromagnetic tomography (BC-VARETA), a novel\
  \ source localization algorithm, as a potential tool to assess brain connectivity\
  \ with 19-channel recordings, which are common in clinical practice. METHODS: We\
  \ explored differences in terms of functional connectivity among the nodes of the\
  \ default mode network between two groups of healthy older participants, one of\
  \ which exhibited an EEG marker of risk for cognitive decline. RESULTS: The risk\
  \ group exhibited increased levels of delta, theta, and beta functional connectivity\
  \ among nodes of the default mode network, as well as reversed directionality patterns\
  \ of connectivity among nodes in every frequency band when compared to the control\
  \ group. DISCUSSION: We propose that an ongoing pathological process may be underway\
  \ in healthy elderly individuals with excess theta activity in their EEGs, which\
  \ is further evidenced by changes in their connectivity patterns. BC-VARETA implemented\
  \ on 19-channels EEG recordings appears to be a promising tool to detect dysfunctions\
  \ at the connectivity level in clinical settings."
