 abstract = {Cognitive deficits in infants born preterm and infants at term with risk factors for brain damage are a common outcome. Attention deficits in preterm infants are related to the development of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and therefore, there is a need for earlier evaluations and treatment procedures that are implemented before the presence of signs of ADHD. Methods We studied preterm (74%) and term infants with the Infant Scale of Selective Attention (ISSA, Escala de Evaluación de la Atención Selectiva (EEAS), in Spanish). This scale evaluates both visual- and auditory-orienting attention. Two groups participated, one with attention deficits (n~=~26) and another with regular performance (n~=~36). An early attention-stimulation program (EASP) was implemented in the infant group with attention deficits from three to eight months of age. All infants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and visual and auditory evoked responses were assessed. Results All infants had prenatal and perinatal risk factors for brain damage and abnormal MRI findings, and the majority had abnormalities compatible with white matter injury. However, there were four infants with porencephalic cysts; 3 of them were in the treated group. At the beginning of the treatment, ISSA values showed differences between groups. These differences persisted for five months in the visual test and up to the sixth month in the auditory evaluation. Afterward, there were no significant differences, indicating that infants with attention deficits had satisfactorily responded to the treatment. Conclusions The ISSA is helpful for the early evaluation of visual and auditory attention. Infants with attention deficits react well enough after six months of EASP.},
