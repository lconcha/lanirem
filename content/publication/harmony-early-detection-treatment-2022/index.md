abstract: Cognitive deficits in infants born preterm and infants at term with risk
  factors for brain damage are a common outcome. Attention deficits in preterm infants
  are related to the development of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
  and therefore, there is a need for earlier evaluations and treatment procedures
  that are implemented before the presence of signs of ADHD. Methods We studied preterm
  (74%) and term infants with the Infant Scale of Selective Attention (ISSA, Escala
  de Evaluación de la Atención Selectiva (EEAS), in Spanish). This scale evaluates
  both visual- and auditory-orienting attention. Two groups participated, one with
  attention deficits (n~=~26) and another with regular performance (n~=~36). An early
  attention-stimulation program (EASP) was implemented in the infant group with attention
  deficits from three to eight months of age. All infants underwent magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI), and visual and auditory evoked responses were assessed. Results All
  infants had prenatal and perinatal risk factors for brain damage and abnormal MRI
  findings, and the majority had abnormalities compatible with white matter injury.
  However, there were four infants with porencephalic cysts; 3 of them were in the
  treated group. At the beginning of the treatment, ISSA values showed differences
  between groups. These differences persisted for five months in the visual test and
  up to the sixth month in the auditory evaluation. Afterward, there were no significant
  differences, indicating that infants with attention deficits had satisfactorily
  responded to the treatment. Conclusions The ISSA is helpful for the early evaluation
  of visual and auditory attention. Infants with attention deficits react well enough
  after six months of EASP.
