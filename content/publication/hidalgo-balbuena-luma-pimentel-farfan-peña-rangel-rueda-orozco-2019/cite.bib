 abstractnote = {Previous studies indicate that the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) integrates sensorimotor information from cortical and thalamic regions to learn and execute motor habits. However, the exact contribution of sensory representations to this process is still unknown. Here we explore the role of the forelimb somatosensory flow in the DLS during the learning and execution of motor habits. First, we compare rhythmic somesthetic representations in the DLS and primary somatosensory cortex in anesthetized rats, and find that sequential and temporal stimuli contents are more strongly represented in the DLS. Then, using a behavioral protocol in which rats developed a stereotyped motor sequence, functional disconnection experiments, and pharmacologic and optogenetic manipulations in apprentice and expert animals, we reveal that somatosensory thalamic- and cortical-striatal pathways are indispensable for the temporal component of execution. Our results indicate that the somatosensory flow in the DLS provides the temporal reference for the development and execution of motor habits.},
