 abstract = {In parkinsonian conditions, network dynamics in the cortical and basal ganglia circuits present abnormal oscillations and periods of high synchrony, affecting the functionality of multiple striatal regions including the sensorimotor striatum. However, it is still unclear how these altered dynamics impact on sensory processing, a key feature for motor control that is severely impaired in parkinsonian patients. A major confound is that pathological dynamics in sensorimotor networks may elicit unspecific motor responses that may alter sensory representations through sensory feedback, making it difficult to disentangle motor and sensory components. To address this issue, we studied sensory processing using an anesthetized model with robust sensory representations throughout cortical and basal ganglia sensory regions and limited motor confounds in control and hemiparkinsonian rats. A general screening of sensory-evoked activity in large populations of neurons recorded in the primary sensory cortex (S1), dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) revealed increased excitability and altered sensory representations in the three regions. Further analysis revealed uncoordinated population dynamics between DLS and S1/SNr. Finally, DLS lesions in hemiparkinsonian animals partially recovered population dynamics and execution in the rotarod.},
