abstract: In parkinsonian conditions, network dynamics in the cortical and basal ganglia
  circuits present abnormal oscillations and periods of high synchrony, affecting
  the functionality of multiple striatal regions including the sensorimotor striatum.
  However, it is still unclear how these altered dynamics impact on sensory processing,
  a key feature for motor control that is severely impaired in parkinsonian patients.
  A major confound is that pathological dynamics in sensorimotor networks may elicit
  unspecific motor responses that may alter sensory representations through sensory
  feedback, making it difficult to disentangle motor and sensory components. To address
  this issue, we studied sensory processing using an anesthetized model with robust
  sensory representations throughout cortical and basal ganglia sensory regions and
  limited motor confounds in control and hemiparkinsonian rats. A general screening
  of sensory-evoked activity in large populations of neurons recorded in the primary
  sensory cortex (S1), dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and substantia nigra pars reticulata
  (SNr) revealed increased excitability and altered sensory representations in the
  three regions. Further analysis revealed uncoordinated population dynamics between
  DLS and S1/SNr. Finally, DLS lesions in hemiparkinsonian animals partially recovered
  population dynamics and execution in the rotarod.
