abstract: Maternal nutritional programming by caloric exposure during pregnancy and
  lactation results in long-term behavioral modification in the offspring. Here, we
  characterized the effect of maternal caloric exposure on synaptic and brain morphological
  organization and its effects on depression-like behavior susceptibility in rats'
  offspring. Female Wistar rats were exposed to chow or cafeteria (CAF) diet for 9
  weeks (pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, and lactation) and then switched to chow diet after
  weaning. By postnatal day 60, the male Wistar rat offspring were tested for depressive-like
  behavior using operational conditioning, novelty suppressed feeding, sucrose preference,
  and open-field test. Brain macro and microstructural morphology were analyzed using
  magnetic resonance imaging deformation-based morphometry (DBM) and western blot,
  immunohistochemistry for NMDA and AMPA receptor, synaptophysin and myelin, respectively.
  We found that the offspring of mothers exposed to CAF diet displayed deficient motivation
  showing decrease in the operant conditioning, sucrose preference, and suppressed
  feeding test. Macrostructural DBM analysis showed reduction in the frontomesocorticolimbic
  circuit volume including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), hippocampus, and prefrontal
  cortex. Microstructural analysis revealed reduced synaptic terminals in hippocampus
  and NAc, whereas increased glial fibrillary acidic protein in hippocampus and lateral
  hypothalamus, as well as a decrease in the hippocampal cell number and myelin reduction
  in the dentate gyrus and hilus, respectively. Also, offspring exhibited increase
  of the GluR1 and GLUR2 subunits of AMPA receptor, whereas a decrease in the mGluR2
  expression in hippocampus. Our findings reveal that maternal programming might prime
  depression-like behavior in the offspring by modulating macro and micro brain organization
  of the frontomesocorticolimbic circuit.
