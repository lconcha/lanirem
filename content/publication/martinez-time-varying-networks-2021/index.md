abstract: Focused attention to spontaneous sensations is a dynamic process that demands
  interoceptive abilities. Failure to control it has been linked to neuropsychiatric
  disorders like illness-anxiety disorder. Regulatory strategies, such as focused
  attention meditation (FAM), may enhance the ability to control focused attention
  particularly to body sensations, which can be reflected on functional neuroanatomy.
  The functional connectivity (FC) related to focused attention has been described,
  however, the dynamic brain organization associated to this process and the differences
  to the resting state remains to be studied. To quantify the cerebral dynamic counterpart
  of focused attention to interoception, we examined fifteen experienced meditators
  while performing a 20-min attentional task to spontaneous sensations. Subjects underwent
  three scanning sessions obtaining a resting-state scan before and after the task.
  Sliding window dynamic FC (DFC) and k-means clustering identified five recurrent
  FC patterns along the dorsal attention network (DAN), default mode network (DMN),
  and frontoparietal network (FPN). Subjects remained longer in a low connectivity
  brain pattern during the resting conditions. By contrast, subjects spent a higher
  proportion of time in complex patterns during the task than rest. Moreover, a carry-over
  effect in FC was observed following the interoceptive task performance, suggestive
  of an active role in the learning process linked to cognitive training. Our results
  suggest that focused attention to interoceptive processes, demands a dynamic brain
  organization with specific features that distinguishes it from the resting condition.
  This approach may provide new insights characterizing the neural basis of the focused
  attention, an essential component for human adaptability.
