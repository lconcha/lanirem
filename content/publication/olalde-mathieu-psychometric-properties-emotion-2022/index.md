abstract: The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) measures the use of two emotional
  regulation strategies, cognitive reappraisal, and expressive suppression. Although
  widely used, there is no description of the psychometric properties of the ERQ and
  its correlations with alexithymia and empathy in a Mexican sample. We examine the
  psychometric properties of the ERQ in a Mexican sample (N = 792) assessing its correlations
  with alexithymia and empathy utilizing the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and the Interpersonal
  Reactivity Index. Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the two-factor model. Each
  factor showed acceptable levels of Cronbach's alpha reliability scores. Cognitive
  reappraisal scores correlated negatively with alexithymia and positively with higher
  empathy measures, while expressive suppression correlated positively with alexithymia
  and personal distress, and negatively with cognitive empathy scales and empathic
  concern. The ERQ has strong psychometric properties in a Mexican sample and can
  be applied in a confident manner in conjunction with other tests to complement the
  assessment of affective traits. In addition, considering previous suggestions regarding
  the relation between emotion regulation strategies and different components of the
  empathic response, the correlations between empathy measures and the emotional regulation
  strategies shown in this study opens a pathway to further research such interactions.
