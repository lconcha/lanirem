abstract: "Prenatal and perinatal risk factors for perinatal brain damage frequently\
  \ produce brain injuries in preterm and term infants. The early diagnosis and treatment\
  \ of these infants, in the period of higher brain plasticity, may prevent the neurological\
  \ and cognitive sequels that accompany these lesions. The Neurodevelopmental Research\
  \ Unit at the Institute of Neurobiology of the National Autonomous University of\
  \ Mexico has taken this endeavor. A multidisciplinary approach is followed. Pediatric,\
  \ neurologic and rehabilitation clinical studies, MRI, EEG, visual and auditory\
  \ evoked responses, and Bayley II evaluations are carried out initially. Infants\
  \ are followed up to 8 years, with periodic appointments for evaluation and treatment.\
  \ Katona's neurohabilitation method is used for initial diagnosis and treatment.\
  \ Selective visual and auditory attention are explored from 3 months of age. This\
  \ method was created in the Unit and, if deficiencies are observed, the method also\
  \ describes the treatment to avoid subsequent alterations of these processes. Deficiencies\
  \ in the acquisition of language are evaluated from 4 months of age, implementing\
  \ treatment through instructions to parents on how they should teach their children\
  \ to speak. This method has also been developed in the Unit and is in its validation\
  \ process. In the MRI, we pay special attention to subtle and diffuse patterns,\
  \ due to the high frequency with which they appear in contemporary cohorts at a\
  \ national and international level. More than 80% of these infants showed abnormal\
  \ MRI findings that should be taken into consideration. The outcome of children\
  \ at 8 years old showed that 78%, 76% and 78% of extremely preterm, very preterm\
  \ and late preterm, respectively, had a normal neurodevelopment. In term infants,\
  \ only 69% had a normal neurodevelopment; in this group, the majority of infants\
  \ had very severe brain lesions. Conclusions: It is necessary to evaluate, at an\
  \ early age, all newborns with prenatal and perinatal risk factors for brain damage.\
  \ Special attention should be payed to all premature newborns and those newborns\
  \ who have been discharged from the intensive care unit."
