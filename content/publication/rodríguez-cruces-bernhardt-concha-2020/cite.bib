Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is known to affect large-scale structural networks and cognitive function in multiple domains. The study of complex relations between structural network organization and cognition requires comprehensive analytical methods and a shift towards multivariate techniques. Here, we sought to identify multidimensional associations between cognitive performance and structural network topology in TLE.
Methods
We studied 34 drug-resistant adult TLE patients and 24 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Participants underwent a comprehensive neurocognitive battery and multimodal MRI, allowing for large-scale connectomics, and morphological evaluation of subcortical and neocortical regions. Using canonical correlation analysis, we identified a multivariate mode that links cognitive performance to a brain structural network. Our approach was complemented by bootstrap-based hierarchical clustering to derive cognitive subtypes and associated patterns of macroscale connectome anomalies.
Results
Both methodologies provided converging evidence for a close coupling between cognitive impairments across multiple domains and large-scale structural network compromise. Cognitive classes presented with an increasing gradient of abnormalities (increasing cortical and subcortical atrophy and less efficient white matter connectome organization in patients with increasing degrees of cognitive impairments). Notably, network topology characterized cognitive performance better than morphometric measures did.
Conclusions
Our multivariate approach emphasized a close coupling of cognitive dysfunction and large-scale network anomalies in TLE. Our findings contribute to understand the complexity of structural connectivity regulating the heterogeneous cognitive deficits found in epilepsy.},
