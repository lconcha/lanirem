abstract: 'The increase of violence in Mexico and consequent suffering during the
  last decades is evident, but its effects over feelings and moral judgments remain
  uncertain. We used journalistic news showing real-life situations to investigate
  the effects of facing violence over the experience of four moral emotions which
  represent powerful impulses for social actions in situations of suffering linked
  to violence: Negative Compassion, Positive Compassion, Schadenfreude, and Indignation.
  We evaluate brain activation by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
  during three cognitive conditions: reading, introspection, and resting. When reading
  the news, only Indignation-evoking stimuli elicited salient brain activations in
  the posterior cerebellum, and temporal and parietal cortical regions, whose functions
  are related to anger experiences and processing of socially relevant circumstances.
  When introspecting the emotional experience, cerebellar, frontal, parietal, and
  occipital activations related to self-focused experiences were observed for all
  emotions. When resting after facing the stimuli, only the Negative Compassion emotion
  elicited brain activations in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus related
  to emotional self-reference processing; thus, negative compassion may produce more
  perdurable cognitive-affective effects related to sadness while perceiving suffering
  in others. Our results may suggest different emotional-based social decisions to
  face suffering and violence and to motivate pro-social actions in the collectivistic
  Mexican culture.'
