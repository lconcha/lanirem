 abstractnote = {It is well known that sleep deprivation impairs fear memory processes, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms or circuits. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of total sleep deprivation (24 h) on contextual fear memory acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval, as well as c-Fos activity in the hippocampus and amygdala. Fear memory recall was associated with an increase in the number of c-Fos-positive cells in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Total sleep deprivation before to the acquisition and during consolidation of memory impaired retrieval and blocked the associated c-Fos activity in the hippocampus and amygdala. In contrast, total sleep deprivation before memory recall also impaired retrieval, but selectively prevented the increase of c-Fos activity in the amygdala (but not in the hippocampus). Our data indicate that sleep is essential not only for acquisition and consolidation but also for the retrieval of fear memories. They also suggest a differential susceptibility of specific memory-related neural circuits (hippocampus and BLA) to the absence of sleep.},
