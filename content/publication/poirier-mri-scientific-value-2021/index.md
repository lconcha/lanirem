abstract: Sharing and pooling large amounts of non-human primate neuroimaging data
  offer new exciting opportunities to understand the primate brain. The potential
  of big data in non-human primate neuroimaging could however be tremendously enhanced
  by combining such neuroimaging data with other types of information. Here we describe
  metadata that have been identified as particularly valuable by the non-human primate
  neuroimaging community, including behavioural, genetic, physiological and phylogenetic
  data.
