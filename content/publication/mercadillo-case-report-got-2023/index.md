abstract: Listening to music has progressively been proposed as a complementary alternative
  for chronic pain; understanding its properties and its neurobiological bases is
  urgent. We show a phenomenological investigation of a woman who has lived 20, years
  with chronic pain. The inquiry involved her experience of the context in which she
  listens to music, the intensity and quality of pain, body mapping, memories, emotions,
  and cognition. The participant listens to music for different reasons, such as pain
  and anxiety relief, motivation to exercise, and quality of sleep, but all seem to
  revolve around different strategies for pain management. Experiences in physiological
  and cognitive aspects included perceived restorative sleep that may have improved
  the participant's general wellbeing and improved cognitive and motor performance
  as well as communication skills. The music enabled the participant not only to relieve
  pain but also withdrawal effects after discontinuing her opioid-based treatment.
  These effects may encompass endogenous opioid and dopamine mechanisms involving
  natural analgesia associated with pleasurable experiences. Future studies could
  consider phenomenological case studies and therapeutic accompaniment to reorient
  subjective properties of pain and expand quantitative and qualitative knowledge
  for more comprehensive reports on music and analgesia.
