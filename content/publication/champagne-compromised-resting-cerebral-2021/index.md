abstract: Altered resting cerebral blood flow (CBF0) in the acute phase post-concussion
  may contribute to neurobehavioral deficiencies, often reported weeks after the injury.
  However, in addition to changes in CBF0, little is known about other physiological
  mechanisms that may be disturbed within the cerebrovasculature. The aim of this
  study was to assess whether changes in baseline perfusion following sport-related
  concussion (SRC) were co-localized with changes in cerebral metabolic demand. Forty-two
  subjects (15 SRC patients 8.0,$Â±$,4.6~days post-injury and 27 age-matched healthy
  control athletes) were studied cross-sectionally. CBF0, cerebrovascular reactivity
  (CVR), resting oxygen extraction (OEF0) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption
  (CMRO2|0) were measured using a combination of hypercapnic and hyperoxic breathing
  protocols, and the biophysical model developed in calibrated MRI. Blood oxygenation
  level dependent and perfusion data were acquired simultaneously using a dual-echo
  arterial spin labelling sequence. SRC patients showed significant decreases in CBF0
  spread across the grey-matter (P,$<$,0.05, corrected), and these differences were
  also confounded by the effects of baseline end-tidal CO2 (P,$<$,0.0001). Lower perfusion
  was co-localized with reductions in regional CMRO2|0 (P,=,0.006) post-SRC, despite
  finding no group-differences in OEF0 (P,=,0.800). Higher CVR within voxels showing
  differences in CBF was also observed in the SRC group (P,=,0.001), compared to controls.
  Reductions in metabolic demand despite no significant changes in OEF0 suggests that
  hypoperfusion post-SRC may reflect compromised metabolic function after the injury.
  These results provide novel insight about the possible pathophysiological mechanisms
  underlying concussion that may affect the clinical recovery of athletes after sport-related
  head injuries.
