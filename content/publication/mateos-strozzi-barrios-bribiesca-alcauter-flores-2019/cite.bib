 abstractnote = {A voxel-based method for measuring sulcal width was developed, validated and applied to a database. This method (EDT-based LM) employs the 3D Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) of the pial surface and a Local Maxima labeling algorithm. A computational phantom was designed to test method performance; results revealed the method’s inaccuracy δ, to range between 0.1 and 0.5 voxels, for a width that varied between 1 and 7 voxels. Two morphological descriptors were computed to characterize each defined sulcus: mean sulcal width (MSW) and mean absolute deviation (MAD). The former is the average width for all available width measurements within the sulcus, and the latter is the deviation of these measurements. The EDT-based LM method was applied to the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in the Alzheimer’s Disease (MIRIAD) database, for a set of high-resolution Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of 66 subjects: 43 patients with Alzheimer Disease (AD) and 23 control subjects. AD causes significant gray matter loss; hence, some sulci were expected to broaden. Methodological results concurred with this hypothesis. After a Wilcoxon test, MSW was grater in the case of all sulci pertaining to AD patients, (p < 0.05, FDR corrected), whereas MAD showed significant differences in 8 sulci (p < 0.05, FDR corrected). This work presents a novel voxel-based method for measuring sulcal width and extracting descriptors to characterize and compare the sulci within and across subjects.},
