abstract: Adolescence is a developmental period that dramatically impacts body and
  behavior, with pubertal hormones playing an important role not only in the morphological
  changes in the body but also in brain structure and function. Understanding brain
  development during adolescence has become a priority in neuroscience because it
  coincides with the onset of many psychiatric and behavioral disorders. However,
  little is known about how puberty influences the brain functional connectome. In
  this study, taking a longitudinal human sample of typically developing children
  and adolescents (of both sexes), we demonstrate that the development of the brain
  functional connectome better fits pubertal status than chronological age. In particular,
  centrality, segregation, efficiency, and integration of the brain functional connectome
  increase after the onset of the pubertal markers. We found that these effects are
  stronger in attention and task control networks. Lastly, after controlling for this
  effect, we showed that functional connectivity between these networks is related
  to better performance in cognitive flexibility. This study points out the importance
  of considering longitudinal nonlinear trends when exploring developmental trajectories,
  and emphasizes the impact of puberty on the functional organization of the brain
  in adolescence.
