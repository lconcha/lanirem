 abstract = {Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain, as well as numerous symptoms related to central sensitization such as: fatigue, cognitive disturbances, constipation/diarrhea and sensory hypersensitivity. Furthermore, depression and anxiety are prevalent comorbidities, accompanied by emotion processing and regulation difficulties. Although fibromyalgia physiopathology is still not fully understood, neuroimaging research methods have shown brain structural and functional alterations as well as neuroinflammation abnormalities. We believe that open access to data may help fibromyalgia research advance more. Here, we present an open dataset of 33 fibromyalgia female patients and 33 paired healthy controls recruited from a Mexican population. Dataset includes demographic, clinical, behavioural and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The MRI data consists of: structural (T1- and T2- weighted) and functional (task-based and resting state) sequences. The task was an emotion processing and regulation task based on visual stimuli. The MRI data contained in the repository are unprocessed, presented in Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format and available on the OpenNeuro platform for future analysis.},
