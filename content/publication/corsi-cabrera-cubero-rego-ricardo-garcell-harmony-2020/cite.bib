 abstractnote = {Spectral analysis of neonatal sleep is useful for studying brain maturation; however, most studies have analyzed conventional broad bands described for awake adults, so a distinct approach for EEG analysis may disclose new findings.
STUDY OBJECTIVES: To extract independent EEG broad bands using principal component analysis (PCA) and describe week-by-week EEG changes in quiet sleep (QS) and active sleep (AS) during the first 5 weeks of postnatal life in healthy, full-term newborns.
METHODS: Polysomnography of spontaneous sleep was recorded in 60 newborns in 5 groups at 41, 42, 43, 44, and 45 weeks (n = 12 each) postconceptional age (POST-C). QS and AS stages were identified. Absolute power (AP) for 1 Hz bins between 1 and 30 Hz was subjected to PCA to extract independent broad bands.
RESULTS: PCA rendered three independent broad bands distinct from conventional bands. They explained 82.8% of variance: 2-10 Hz, 10-16 Hz, and 17-30 Hz. ANOVAs (group × age × derivations) showed significant higher power at 2-10 Hz with greater age, higher power in QS than AS in all three bands, and significantly higher AP in the left central region, and in the right occipital and temporal areas, in both sleep stages.
CONCLUSION: A different method of analyzing sleep EEG generated new information on brain maturation. The Sigma frequencies identified suggest that sleep spindle maturation begins by at least 41 weeks of POST-C age. Interhemispheric asymmetries during sleep suggest earlier development of the central left region and the right occipital and temporal areas.},
