 abstractnote = {Human musicality is a complex problem because it involves the coupling of multiple exogenous and endogenous signals with different physical properties. The synchronization of these signals translates into specific behaviors. The study of this synchronization, based on the physical properties of two oscillatory bodies, is the first step in understanding the behaviors associated with rhythmic auditory stimuli. In recent years, different neurorehabilitation therapies have emerged for motor pathologies involving music. However, the neurophysiological bases that describe the coupling phenomenon are not yet fully understood. In this article, two theories are addressed that attempt to explain the convergence of the auditory system and the motor system according to new neuroanatomical, neurophysiological and artificial neural network findings. It also reflects on the different approaches to a complex problem in cognitive neuroscience and the need for a study model for the different motor behaviors evoked by auditory stimuli.},
