abstract: Modulation of reflex responses is crucial to adapt our behavior and cognition,
  and this is especially difficult when biological relevant stimuli are present such
  as emotional faces. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of peripherally
  presented happy and angry facial expressions in reflexive saccades and saccadic
  inhibition/re-orientation of attention. Behavior through eye-tracking technique
  and fMRI event-related BOLD signals activations were evaluated in adult males during
  the performance of an antisaccade task. fMRI signals obtained during task performance
  were compared to a baseline. Results showed that antisaccades had a lower percentage
  of correct responses and higher latency onsets than prosaccades. At the activation
  brain level, differences between both emotions and the baseline were found during
  stimuli presentation. Prosaccades for happy and angry faces recruited larger clusters
  with higher Z values mainly in occipito-parietal and temporal regions related to
  visual basic and integration processing, as well as regions of the oculomotor network.
  Meanwhile, when compared to the baseline, antisaccades recruited similar areas but
  a lower number of clusters with lower Z values as expected for peripheral processing
  of faces. At antisaccades, happy faces recruited parieto-occipital, temporal and
  cerebellar regions, while the angry faces added activation of orbital and ventrolateral
  prefrontal cortex related to emotional regulation. These results suggest that emotional
  facial expressions are being processed outside of the focus of attention. Particularly,
  angry expressions recruit a wider brain network in order to inhibit automatic behavior
  and re-orientate voluntary attention efficiently that may be due to its biological
  relevance.
