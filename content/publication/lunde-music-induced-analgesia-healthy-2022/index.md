abstract: "Music interventions accommodate the profound need for non-pharmacological\
  \ pain treatment. The analgesic effect of listening to music has been widely demonstrated\
  \ across studies. Yet, the specific mechanisms of action have still to be elucidated.\
  \ Although the endogenous opioid and dopamine systems have been suggested to play\
  \ an important role, a direct link has not been established. In addition, the involvement\
  \ of placebo mechanisms is likely while largely unexplored. We examined the analgesic\
  \ effect of music in healthy participants (n = 48) using a 3 × 3 within-subjects\
  \ design with pharmacological manipulations and a matched, auditory control for\
  \ music. Participants were exposed to thermal pain stimuli while listening to three\
  \ auditory excerpts: music (active condition), nature sound (matched, auditory contextual\
  \ condition), and noise (neutral control condition). The participants rated their\
  \ expected and perceived pain levels in relation to each of the auditory excerpts.\
  \ To investigate the involvement of the endogenous opioid and dopamine systems,\
  \ the test session was performed three times on separate days featuring a double-blind\
  \ randomized oral administration of naltrexone (opioid antagonist), haloperidol\
  \ (dopamine antagonist), and an inactive agent (control). Our results support an\
  \ analgesic effect of music. Contrary to current hypotheses, neither of the antagonists\
  \ attenuated the effect of music. Yet, the participants' expectations for pain relief\
  \ predicted their perceived pain levels during the auditory excerpts—even when controlling\
  \ for a gradual learning effect. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the analgesic\
  \ effect of music is at least partially mediated by expectations of an analgesic\
  \ effect—a core mechanism in placebo effects—but not by opioid and dopamine-dependent\
  \ mechanisms."
