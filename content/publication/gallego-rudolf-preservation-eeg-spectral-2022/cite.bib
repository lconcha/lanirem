 abstract = {Introduction: Electroencephalographic (EEG) data quality is severely compromised when recorded inside the Magnetic Resonance (MR) environment. Here we characterized the impact of the ballistocardiographic (BCG) artifact on resting-state EEG spectral properties and compared the effectiveness of seven common BCG correction methods to preserve EEG spectral features. We also assessed if these methods retained posterior alpha power reactivity to an eyes closure-opening (EC-EO) task and compared the results from EEG-informed fMRI analysis using different BCG correction approaches. Method: EEG data from 20 healthy young adults were recorded outside the MR environment and during simultaneous fMRI acquisition. The gradient artifact was effectively removed from EEG-fMRI acquisitions using average artifact subtraction (AAS). The BCG artifact was corrected with seven methods: AAS, Optimal Basis Set (OBS), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), OBS followed by ICA, AAS followed by ICA , PROJIC-AAS and PROJIC-OBS . EEG signal preservation was assessed by comparing the spectral power of traditional frequency bands from the corrected rs-EEG-fMRI data with the data recorded outside the scanner. We then assessed the preservation of posterior alpha functional reactivity by computing the ratio between the EC and EO conditions during the EC-EO task. EEG-informed fMRI analysis of the EC-EO task was performed using alpha power-derived BOLD signal predictors obtained from the EEG signals corrected with different methods. Results: The BCG artifact caused significant distortions (increased absolute power, altered relative power ) across all frequency bands. Artifact residuals/signal losses were present after applying all correction methods. The EEG reactivity to the EC-EO task was better preserved with ICA-based correction approaches, particularly when using ICA feature extraction to isolate alpha power fluctuations, which allowed to accurately predict hemodynamic signal fluctuations during the EEG-informed fMRI analysis. Discussion: Current software solutions for the BCG artifact problem offer limited efficiency to preserve the EEG spectral power properties using this particular EEG setup. The state-of-the-art approaches tested here can be further refined and should be combined with hardware implementations to better preserve EEG signal properties during simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Existing and novel BCG artifact correction methods should be validated by evaluating signal preservation of both ERPs and spontaneous EEG spectral power.},
