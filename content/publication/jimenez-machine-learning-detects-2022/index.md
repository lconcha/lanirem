abstract: Only 50% of the patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) respond
  to psychotherapies, such as Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), this might be
  increased by identifying baseline predictors of clinical change. We use machine
  learning to detect clinical features that could predict improvement/worsening for
  severity and impulsivity of BPD after DBT skills training group. To predict illness
  severity, we analyzed data from 125 patients with BPD divided into 17 DBT psychotherapy
  groups, and for impulsiveness we analyzed 89 patients distributed into 12 DBT groups.
  All patients were evaluated at baseline using widely self-report tests; $∼$70% of
  the sample were randomly selected and two machine learning models (lasso and Random
  forest [Rf]) were trained using 10-fold cross-validation and compared to predict
  the post-treatment response. Models' generalization was assessed in $∼$30% of the
  remaining sample. Relevant variables for DBT (i.e. the mindfulness ability ``non-judging'',
  or ``non-planning'' impulsiveness) measured at baseline, were robust predictors
  of clinical change after six months of weekly DBT sessions. Using 10-fold cross-validation,
  the Rf model had significantly lower prediction error than lasso for the BPD severity
  variable, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) lasso - Rf~=~1.55 (95% CI, 0.63–2.48) as well
  as for impulsivity, MAE lasso - Rf~=~1.97 (95% CI, 0.57–3.35). According to Rf and
  the permutations method, 34/613 significant predictors for severity and 17/613 for
  impulsivity were identified. Using machine learning to identify the most important
  variables before starting DBT could be fundamental for personalized treatment and
  disease prognosis.
