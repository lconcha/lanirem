abstract: Our sensory systems provide complementary information about the multimodal
  objects and events that are the target of perception in everyday life. Professional
  musicians' specialization in the auditory domain is reflected in the morphology
  of their brains, which has distinctive characteristics, particularly in areas related
  to auditory and audio-motor activity. Here, we combined diffusion tensor imaging
  (DTI) with a behavioral measure of visually induced gain in pitch discrimination,
  and we used measures of cortical thickness (CT) correlations to assess how auditory
  specialization and musical expertise are reflected in the structural architecture
  of white and grey matter relevant to audiovisual processing. Across all participants
  (n,=,45), we found a correlation (p,$<$ 0.001) between reliance on visual cues in
  pitch discrimination and the fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left inferior fronto-occipital
  fasciculus (IFOF), a structure connecting visual and auditory brain areas. Group
  analyses also revealed greater cortical thickness correlation between visual and
  auditory areas in non-musicians (n,=,28) compared to musicians (n,=,17), possibly
  reflecting musicians' auditory specialization (FDR,$<$,10%). Our results corroborate
  and expand current knowledge of functional specialization with a specific focus
  on audition, and highlight the fact that perception is essentially multimodal while
  uni-sensory processing is a specialized task.
