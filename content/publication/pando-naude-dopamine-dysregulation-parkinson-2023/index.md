abstract: The pleasurable urge to move to music (PLUMM) activates motor and reward
  areas of the brain and is thought to be driven by predictive processes. Dopamine
  in motor and limbic networks is implicated in beat-based timing and music-induced
  pleasure, suggesting a central role of basal ganglia (BG) dopaminergic systems in
  PLUMM. This study tested this hypothesis by comparing PLUMM in participants with
  Parkinson's disease (PD), age-matched controls, and young controls. Participants
  listened to musical sequences with varying rhythmic and harmonic complexity (low,
  medium and high), and rated their experienced pleasure and urge to move to the rhythm.
  In line with previous results, healthy younger participants showed an inverted U-shaped
  relationship between rhythmic complexity and ratings, with preference for medium
  complexity rhythms, while age-matched controls showed a similar, but weaker, inverted
  U-shaped response. Conversely, PD showed a significantly flattened response for
  both the urge to move and pleasure. Crucially, this flattened response could not
  be attributed to differences in rhythm discrimination and did not reflect an overall
  decrease in ratings. For harmonic complexity, PD showed a negative linear pattern
  for both the urge to move and pleasure while healthy age-matched controls showed
  the same pattern for pleasure and an inverted U for the urge to move. This contrasts
  with the pattern observed in young healthy controls in previous studies, suggesting
  that both healthy aging and PD also influence affective responses to harmonic complexity.
  Together, these results support the role of dopamine within cortico-striatal circuits
  in the predictive processes that form the link between the perceptual processing
  of rhythmic patterns and the affective and motor responses to rhythmic music.
