abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a global condition lacking effective
  treatment. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may reduce craving
  and frequency of cocaine use, but little is known about its efficacy and neural
  effects. We sought to elucidate short- and long-term clinical benefits of 5-Hz rTMS
  as an add-on to standard treatment in patients with CUD and discern underlying functional
  connectivity effects using magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: A total of 44 patients
  with CUD were randomly assigned to complete the 2-week double-blind randomized controlled
  trial (acute phase) (sham [n~= 20, 2 female] and active [n~= 24, 4 female]), in
  which they received two daily sessions of rTMS on the left dorsolateral prefrontal
  cortex (PFC). Subsequently, 20 patients with CUD continued to an open-label maintenance
  phase for 6 months (two weekly sessions for up to 6 mo). RESULTS: rTMS plus standard
  treatment for 2 weeks significantly reduced craving (baseline: 3.9 $±$ 3.6; 2 weeks:
  1.5 $±$ 2.4, p~= .013, d~= 0.77) and impulsivity (baseline: 64.8 $±$ 16.8; 2 weeks:
  53.1 $±$ 17.4, p~= .011, d~= 0.79) in the active group. We also found increased
  functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral PFC and ventromedial PFC and
  between the ventromedial PFC and right angular gyrus. Clinical and functional connectivity
  effects were maintained for 3 months, but they dissipated by 6 months. We did not
  observe reduction in positive results for cocaine in urine; however, self-reported
  frequency and grams consumed for 6 months were reduced. CONCLUSIONS: With this randomized
  controlled trial, we show that 5-Hz rTMS has potential promise as an adjunctive
  treatment for CUD and merits further research.'
