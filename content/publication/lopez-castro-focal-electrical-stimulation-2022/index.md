abstract: Neuromodulation interventions, such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) and
  repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), are proposed as possible new
  complementary therapies to treat substance use disorders (SUD) such as alcohol use
  disorder (AUD). It is hypothesized that neuromodulation may induce neural plasticity
  in the reward and frontostriatal systems via electrical field induction, possibly
  reducing symptoms. Preclinical self-administration rodent models of AUD may help
  us gain insight into the effects of neuromodulation therapies on different pathology,
  as well as the neural mechanisms behind the positive effects. DBS, or any type of
  brain stimulation using intracranial electrodes in rodents, would benefit from the
  use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the longitudinal effects and mechanisms
  of stimulation as well as novel targets, as it is a non-invasive technique that
  allows the analysis of structural and functional changes in the brain. To do this,
  there is a need for MRI-compatible electrodes that allow for MRI acquisition with
  minimal distortion of the magnetic field. In this protocol, we present a method
  for the construction and surgery of chronically implantable monopolar carbon electrodes
  for use in rats. Unlike conventional electrodes, carbon electrodes are resistant
  to high temperatures, flexible, and generate fewer artifacts in MRI compared to
  conventional ones. We validated its use by using a focal electrical stimulation
  high-frequency (20 Hz) protocol that lasted $âˆ¼$10 sessions. We propose that this
  technique can also be used for the research of the neurophysiological bases of the
  neuromodulatory treatment in other preclinical substance use disorders (SUD) models.
