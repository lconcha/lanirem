 abstract = {Neuromodulation interventions, such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) and repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), are proposed as possible new complementary therapies to treat substance use disorders (SUD) such as alcohol use disorder (AUD). It is hypothesized that neuromodulation may induce neural plasticity in the reward and frontostriatal systems via electrical field induction, possibly reducing symptoms. Preclinical self-administration rodent models of AUD may help us gain insight into the effects of neuromodulation therapies on different pathology, as well as the neural mechanisms behind the positive effects. DBS, or any type of brain stimulation using intracranial electrodes in rodents, would benefit from the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the longitudinal effects and mechanisms of stimulation as well as novel targets, as it is a non-invasive technique that allows the analysis of structural and functional changes in the brain. To do this, there is a need for MRI-compatible electrodes that allow for MRI acquisition with minimal distortion of the magnetic field. In this protocol, we present a method for the construction and surgery of chronically implantable monopolar carbon electrodes for use in rats. Unlike conventional electrodes, carbon electrodes are resistant to high temperatures, flexible, and generate fewer artifacts in MRI compared to conventional ones. We validated its use by using a focal electrical stimulation high-frequency (20 Hz) protocol that lasted $âˆ¼$10 sessions. We propose that this technique can also be used for the research of the neurophysiological bases of the neuromodulatory treatment in other preclinical substance use disorders (SUD) models.},
