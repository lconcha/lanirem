 abstractnote = {Epilepsy is a chronic brain disease that affects approximately 65 million people worldwide. However, despite the continuous development of antiepileptic drugs, over 30% patients with epilepsy progress to drug-resistant epilepsy. For this reason, it is a high priority objective in preclinical research to find novel therapeutic targets and to develop effective drugs that prevent or reverse the molecular mechanisms underlying epilepsy progression. Among these potential therapeutic targets, we highlight currently available information involving signaling pathways (Wnt/&beta;-catenin, Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and zinc signaling), enzymes (carbonic anhydrase), proteins (erythropoietin, copine 6 and complement system), channels (Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid Type 1 (TRPV1) channel) and receptors (galanin and melatonin receptors). All of them have demonstrated a certain degree of efficacy not only in controlling seizures but also in displaying neuroprotective activity and in modifying the progression of epilepsy. Although some research with these specific targets has been done in relation with epilepsy, they have not been fully explored as potential therapeutic targets that could help address the unsolved issue of drug-resistant epilepsy and develop new antiseizure therapies for the treatment of epilepsy.},
