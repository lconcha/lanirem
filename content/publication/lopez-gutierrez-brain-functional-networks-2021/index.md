abstract: Previous studies have related pair-bonding in Microtus ochrogaster, the
  prairie vole, with plastic changes in several brain regions. However, the interactions
  between these socially relevant regions have yet to be described. In this study,
  we used resting-state magnetic resonance imaging to explore bonding behaviors and
  functional connectivity of brain regions previously associated with pair-bonding.
  Thirty-two male and female prairie voles were scanned at baseline, 24 hr, and 2
  weeks after the onset of cohabitation. By using network-based statistics, we identified
  that the functional connectivity of a corticostriatal network predicted the onset
  of affiliative behavior, while another predicted the amount of social interaction
  during a partner preference test. Furthermore, a network with significant changes
  in time was revealed, also showing associations with the level of partner preference.
  Overall, our findings revealed the association between network-level functional
  connectivity changes and social bonding.
