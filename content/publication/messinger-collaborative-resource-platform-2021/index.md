abstract: Neuroimaging non-human primates (NHPs) is a growing, yet highly specialized
  field of neuroscience. Resources that were primarily developed for human neuroimaging
  often need to be significantly adapted for use with NHPs or other animals, which
  has led to an abundance of custom, in-house solutions. In recent years, the global
  NHP neuroimaging community has made significant efforts to transform the field towards
  more open and collaborative practices. Here we present the PRIMatE Resource Exchange
  (PRIME-RE), a new collaborative online platform for NHP neuroimaging. PRIME-RE is
  a dynamic community-driven hub for the exchange of practical knowledge, specialized
  analytical tools, and open data repositories, specifically related to NHP neuroimaging.
  PRIME-RE caters to both researchers and developers who are either new to the field,
  looking to stay abreast of the latest developments, or seeking to collaboratively
  advance the field .
