abstract: 'As the global health crisis unfolded, many academic conferences moved online
  in 2020. This move has been hailed as a positive step towards inclusivity in its
  attenuation of economic, physical, and legal barriers and effectively enabled many
  individuals from groups that have traditionally been underrepresented to join and
  participate. A number of studies have outlined how moving online made it possible
  to gather a more global community and has increased opportunities for individuals
  with various constraints, e.g., caregiving responsibilities. Yet, the mere existence
  of online conferences is no guarantee that everyone can attend and participate meaningfully.
  In fact, many elements of an online conference are still significant barriers to
  truly diverse participation: the tools used can be inaccessible for some individuals;
  the scheduling choices can favour some geographical locations; the set-up of the
  conference can provide more visibility to well-established researchers and reduce
  opportunities for early-career researchers. While acknowledging the benefits of
  an online setting, especially for individuals who have traditionally been underrepresented
  or excluded, we recognize that fostering social justice requires inclusivity to
  actively be centered in every aspect of online conference design. Here, we draw
  from the literature and from our own experiences to identify practices that purposefully
  encourage a diverse community to attend, participate in, and lead online conferences.
  Reflecting on how to design more inclusive online events is especially important
  as multiple scientific organizations have announced that they will continue offering
  an online version of their event when in-person conferences can resume.'
